### Added

- **HE-AAC v2 decodes end-to-end — PS wired into the SBR decoder,
  99.995% signal-accurate** (`ps_decoder`, `sbr_decoder`,
  `sbr_element`) — the Annex 8.A frame driver composes the whole
  §8.6.4 chain (ps_data parse with persistent header config →
  differential resolution → hybrid analysis of the `Xinput` matrix
  with the 6-slot `XLow` look-ahead → de-correlation with the
  per-frame partial reset above `k_x + M` → stereo mixing → hybrid
  synthesis), staying inactive (mono) until the first header'd
  `ps_data()` per §8.6.5.1, holding parameters over payload-less
  frames, and full-resetting the de-correlator after a missing
  `ps_data()`. `SbrDecoder` renders a PS-carrying SCE as stereo: the
  element's own synthesis bank becomes the left channel, a second
  bank the right, in both the SBR-processed and pure-upsampling
  paths. **Fixed** `sbr_element`'s extended-data capture, which
  truncated the trailing sub-byte of the (non-byte-aligned)
  `sbr_extension()` payload — up to 7 real `ps_data()` bits went lost
  as "fill" (the HE-AAC v2 fixture's second element lost 2 bits and
  failed to parse). Validated end-to-end against the staged HE-AAC v2
  MP4 fixture (`tests/ps_he_aac_v2.rs`, with a minimal ISO 14496-12
  `stsz`/`stco`/`stsc` walk): every access unit decodes to 2×2048
  samples at 32 kHz, and after priming-lag alignment the per-channel
  error-to-signal RMS against the reference decode is **5e-5 (L) /
  4e-5 (R)** — filterbank-rounding level.
- **PS stereo processing** (`ps_stereo`) — ISO/IEC 14496-3:2009
  §8.6.4.6. Dequantization on the Table 8.25/8.26 IID dB grids and
  the Table 8.28 ICC `ρ` grid — **cross-validated against the staged
  fdk-extracted tables**: the `ps-iid-scale-factors.csv` Q30 values
  are exactly the §8.6.4.6.2.1 `c1 = √(2/(1+c²))` over Table 8.25,
  and `ps-icc-alphas.csv` exactly `½·arccos(ρ)` over Table 8.28 —
  mixing procedures Ra (rotation `α = ½arccos ρ`, `β = α(c1−c2)/√2`)
  and Rb (`ρ ≥ 0.05` floor, `arctan` α with the `c = 1` / modulo-π/2
  corrections, `μ`/`γ`), the §8.6.4.6.3.2 IPD/OPD three-position
  complex smoothing with per-band history and the `*`-channel
  conjugation, and the §8.6.4.6.4 linear interpolation between
  envelope borders (FIX `⌊32(e+1)/num_env⌋−1` / VAR positions, the
  first region rising from the previous frame's coefficients, the
  post-border hold, and the §8.6.4.6.5 `num_env == 0` full-frame
  hold). Table 8.47 band-count switches re-map the retained
  coefficients via Tables 8.45/8.46. Pinned by exact scale-factor
  panning at ±25 dB, the ICC = −1 anti-phase decorrelated pair, the
  first-region `n/n₀` ramp, the hold path, the Rb identity point, and
  the Ra `Σh² = 2` energy invariant over the whole cue grid.
- **PS de-correlator + parameter-band maps** (`ps_decorr`, `ps_map`) —
  ISO/IEC 14496-3:2009 §8.6.4.5 / §8.6.4.6.1. The three-link complex
  all-pass chain (Table 8.39 coefficients + delays, Table 8.42
  fractional-delay rotations, `q_φ = 0.39`, the Table 8.40/8.41
  centre-frequency ladders plus their closed-form tails, the
  `DECAY_SLOPE` frequency taper) behind the z⁻²·φ_fract front, the
  14-slot / 1-slot plain delays above `NR_ALLPASS_BANDS`, and the
  §8.6.4.5.3–5.4 transient duck (peak-decay `α = 0.76592833836465`,
  one-pole smoothing `a_smooth = 0.25`, impact `γ = 1.5`) applied per
  Table 8.48/8.49 stereo band. State threads across frames; the Annex
  8.A.3 partial (`k ≥ kmax`) and full resets are exposed. `ps_map`
  carries the Table 8.48/8.49 `b(k)` hybrid→stereo-band maps (the
  34-band table's deliberately non-monotonic split region matches the
  Table 8.41 frequency ladder), the conjugate-flag rows, and the
  Table 8.45/8.46 10↔20↔34 parameter re-mappings in ANSI-C integer
  (and float, for the h hand-over) arithmetic. Pinned by per-band
  energy conservation of the all-pass on stationary noise, the exact
  14/1-slot delay identity with G ≡ 1 on constant level, the
  deterministic post-burst duck profile, partial-reset scoping, and
  the map tables' completeness/spot rows.
- **PS hybrid filterbank** (`ps_hybrid`) — ISO/IEC 14496-3:2009
  §8.6.4.3 / Annex 8.A.3. Both configurations: 10/20 stereo bands (QMF
  band 0 split by 8 with the Figure 8.20 merge/reorder to 6 channels —
  `s0=q6, s1=q7, s2=q0, s3=q1, s4=q2+q5, s5=q3+q4` — bands 1–2 split
  by 2 with the odd-band spectral inversion; 71 hybrid channels) and
  34 bands (12/8/4/4/4 splits, filter order; 91 channels), using the
  Table 8.37/8.38 13-tap prototypes with Type A complex / Type B
  cosine modulation. Implements the Annex 8.A.3 zero-delay alignment:
  6 look-ahead QMF slots feed the convolution, 6 history slots thread
  across frames, unsplit bands pass straight through. `synthesize` is
  the §8.6.4.7 sub-subband adder. Pinned by exact analysis→synthesis
  reconstruction (both configs, across frame boundaries — each
  prototype's sub-filters provably sum to a pure 6-slot delay), by
  sub-subband selectivity tests fixing the positive/negative
  low-frequency channel order, and by the zero-delay pass-through.
- **Parametric Stereo bitstream layer** (`ps_huffman`, `ps_data`) —
  ISO/IEC 14496-3:2009 §8.4.2 Tables 8.9–8.14 + Annex 8.B. All ten PS
  Huffman codebooks (IID coarse/fine × time/freq, ICC, IPD, OPD ×
  time/freq; Tables 8.B.17–8.B.21) transcribed as `(length, codeword)`
  pairs — every table verified a *complete* prefix code (Kraft sum
  exactly 1) and the six IID/ICC books additionally cross-checked
  leaf-for-leaf against the staged `ps-huffbook-*.csv` decode trees.
  `PsData::parse` walks the full `ps_data()` element: the persistent
  `enable_ps_header` configuration block (Tables 8.24/8.27 modes,
  reserved modes rejected), FIX/VAR framing (Table 8.29 `num_env`,
  5-bit border positions), per-envelope IID/ICC delta rows, and the
  byte-counted extension layer (Table 8.10) carrying `enable_ipdopd` +
  IPD/OPD rows; a headerless element with no prior configuration
  resolves to the §8.6.5.1 "mono until a header arrives" signal.
  `PsData::resolve` applies the §8.5.2 time/frequency DPCM
  accumulation against a cross-frame `PsIndexState` (IID/ICC
  range-checked to their Table 8.24/8.27 index ranges, IPD/OPD wrapped
  modulo 8 on the Table 8.31 phase ladder) and handles the
  `num_env == 0` parameter-hold. New `Error::PsDataInvalid` covers the
  malformed cases.
- **HE-AAC v1 over LATM/LOAS** (`latm`) — the `LoasDecoder` no longer
  pre-rejects an SBR-signalling `AudioSpecificConfig` with
  `Error::LatmSbrUnsupported`: both the explicit AOT-5 hierarchical
  wrapper and implicit AAC-LC-only signalling route through the shared
  `decode_raw_data_block` core, whose §4.6.18 `EXT_SBR_DATA` FIL
  auto-detect doubles the output rate exactly as on the ADTS path (a
  PS-signalling stream decodes its HE-AAC v1 layer). The error variant
  is kept (documented as no longer emitted) so existing `match` arms
  stay valid. Pinned by `tests/latm_sbr.rs`: the staged HE-AAC v1 ADTS
  fixture is re-multiplexed access-unit-for-access-unit into a LOAS
  `AudioSyncStream()` (inline `StreamMuxConfig` on the first element,
  `useSameStreamMux` after, `frameLengthType 0` with 255-escape slot
  lengths) and the LATM decode must be **byte-identical** to the ADTS
  decode under both signalling modes.
- **HE-AAC v1 SBR wired into the stream decoder — 99.98% sample-exact**
  (`decode`, `codec_decoder`, `raw_data_block`) — the ADTS
  `StreamDecoder` now walks FIL bodies via a new
  `Walker::next_element_keep_fill` + `extension_payload::
  parse_with_sbr`, attaches each `EXT_SBR_DATA` payload to the
  preceding SCE / CPE, threads the `sbr_header()` reuse state per
  element slot, and — once a stream shows SBR — emits every frame at
  the doubled rate (2048 samples/channel), sending SBR-less frames
  through the §4.6.18.5 pure-upsampling path so the output rate never
  flaps. The coupled-pair `sbr_invf()` sharing (Table 4.66) is
  honoured. The runtime `Decoder` trait derives the per-frame sample
  count from the buffer (1024 core / 2048 dual-rate). **Validated
  against the staged HE-AAC v1 fixture: identical sample count at
  zero lag, ≥ 99.9% byte-exact (measured 99.98%), max per-sample
  error 1 LSB, error-to-signal RMS 1e-5** (`tests/sbr_he_aac.rs`) —
  the same bound the AAC-LC corpus holds — and the trait path is
  pinned byte-identical to the raw `StreamDecoder`. The AAC-LC
  corpus stays untouched (non-SBR streams take the exact old path).
- **SBR frame driver** (`sbr_decoder`) — ISO/IEC 14496-3 §4.6.18.5 /
  Figure 4.47. `SbrDecoder` composes the whole back-end per channel
  element: the analysis QMF over the 1024-sample core frame, the
  `XLow` buffer with the `tHFGen = 8`-slot `W'` cross-frame history,
  header-reset band/patch/limiter derivation (§4.6.18.3.3), quantized
  scalefactor reconstruction (with cross-frame time-delta references)
  → dequantization (coupled or single, with the single-envelope
  FIXFIX `bs_amp_res` override), chirp factors, HF generation,
  envelope adjustment, the §4.6.18.5 output-matrix `X` assembly (the
  `lTemp` splice of the previous frame's `Y'` under the previous
  `kx'/M'` against the current `XLow`/`Y`), and the 64-band synthesis
  producing 2048 output samples per frame (dual-rate). The
  `upsample_frame` path implements the spec's pure-upsampling mode
  for frames without SBR payload, keeping QMF state continuous.
  Pinned by cross-frame upsample continuity against an ideal
  2×-upsampled sine (< 1e-4 error ratio), a synthetic single-envelope
  SBR frame (finite, deterministic, high-band energy scaling with the
  envelope scalefactor), and shape-mismatch rejections.
- **SBR HF adjustment (envelope adjuster)** (`sbr_env_adjust`) +
  **noise table** (`sbr_noise_table`) — ISO/IEC 14496-3 §4.6.18.7,
  the stage that turns `XHigh` into the output matrix `Y`: the
  §4.6.18.7.2 mapping (`EOrigMapped` / `QMapped` to QMF resolution,
  the `SIndexMapped` band-middle sinusoid placement with the `δStep`
  start gate against `lA` and the previous frame's sinusoids, and the
  `SMapped` band flags), the §4.6.18.7.3 `ECurr` estimation (both
  `bs_interpol_freq` regimes), the §4.6.18.7.4 `QM` / `SM` levels and
  §4.6.18.7.5 gain — **read from the spec PDF's typeset equations,
  which carry square roots the plain text layer drops** (`G`, `QM`,
  `SM`, `GMaxTemp`, `GBoostTemp` are all amplitude-domain) — the
  limiter (`limGain = [0.70795, 1.0, 1.41254, 1e10]`, the `10^5` cap,
  per-`fTableLim`-band ratios), the noise-level limit and the boost
  compensation capped at `1.584893192`, and the §4.6.18.7.6 assembly
  (the `hSmooth` 5-tap gain/noise smoothing with cross-frame `GTemp` /
  `QTemp` tails, `W1 = GFilt·XHigh`, the Table 4.A.91 noise mix with
  the running `fIndexNoise = (indexNoise + (i−i0)·M + m + 1) mod 512`,
  and the `φsin` sinusoid injection with the `(−1)^(m+kx)` imaginary
  alternation and the `indexSine` advance). `sbr_noise_table` is the
  512-entry Table 4.A.91 transcribed from the spec PDF (the staged
  `sbr-random-phase.csv` cross-checks every present value to 1e-9 but
  is missing one scalar, so the spec grid is authoritative).
  `EnvAdjustState` threads all cross-frame state and honours the
  §4.6.18.3.3 reset. Pinned by flat-gain envelope reproduction,
  per-envelope gain switching at `tE` borders, limiter clamping with
  boost compensation, noise-floor synthesis with exact `fIndexNoise`
  threading across frames, the sinusoid injection pattern (phase
  ladder, odd-subband alternation, prev-frame ring-on), and the hSL=4
  smoothing carry.
- **SBR limiter frequency band table** (`sbr_limiter`) — ISO/IEC
  14496-3 §4.6.18.3.2.3 / Figure 4.41, previously deferred for the
  patch borders that `sbr_hf_gen::Patches::borders` now supplies.
  `limiter_table` builds `fTableLim`: the `bs_limiter_bands == 0`
  single-band case, the `limiterBandsPerOctave = {1.2, 2, 3}` selector,
  the sorted `fTableLow ∪ interior-patch-borders` union, and the
  Figure 4.41 merge walk (`nOctaves·limBands < 0.49`) that drops
  duplicates and envelope borders while preserving patch borders.
  Pinned by single-band / pass-through / duplicate / patch-preference /
  coarseness-ordering cases.
- **SBR high-frequency generation** (`sbr_hf_gen`) — ISO/IEC 14496-3
  §4.6.18.6. The Figure 4.48 patch construction (`goalSb =
  NINT(2.048e6/FsSBR)`, the `msb`/`usb` walk over `fMaster`, the `odd`
  parity correction, the `fMaster(k) − sb < 3` end-game, the trailing
  small-patch trim, and the §4.6.18.3.6 `numPatches ≤ 5` bound), the
  §4.6.18.6.2 inverse filtering (covariance `φk(i,j)` over
  `numTimeSlots·RATE + 6` samples, `d(k)` with `εInv = 1e-6`, the
  `α0/α1` solution and the `|α| ≥ 4` reset), the Table 4.175 `newBw`
  transition + `bwArray` chirp blend (attack `0.90625/0.09375`, decay
  `0.75/0.25`, `< 0.015625` flush), and the §4.6.18.6.3 generator
  `XHigh(k) = XLow(p) + bw·α0·XLow(p, l−1) + bw²·α1·XLow(p, l−2)` over
  the patch mapping with the per-noise-band `g(k)` chirp selection.
  `Patches::borders` exposes the §4.6.18.3.2.3 patch borders for the
  limiter table. Pinned by a hand-walked Figure 4.48 case, the trim
  case, invariants on a spec-derived 44.1 kHz master table, exact
  AR(2) recovery (`α = −a` to the `O(εInv)` relaxation), the
  `|α| ≥ 4` reset, and bw = 0 copy / bw = 1 whitening.
- **SBR dequantization + stereo decoding** (`sbr_dequant`) — ISO/IEC
  14496-3 §4.6.18.3.5. Converts the reconstructed quantized
  scalefactors to linear energies: `EOrig = 64·2^(E/a)` (`a = 2` /
  `1` per `bs_amp_res`), `QOrig = 2^(NOISE_FLOOR_OFFSET − Q)`
  (§4.6.18.2.5 `NOISE_FLOOR_OFFSET = 6`), and the coupled-pair split
  with `panOffset = [24, 12]` (§4.6.18.2.6) dividing the doubled
  average by `1 + 2^(±(panOffset − E1)/a)`. Pinned by exact
  power-of-two vectors, the balanced-pan symmetry, and the
  `ELeft + ERight = 2·EOrig` energy-sum identity across pan values
  and both amplitude resolutions.
- **SBR time / frequency grid** (`sbr_time_grid`) — ISO/IEC 14496-3
  §4.6.18.3.3. `derive_time_grid` turns a parsed `sbr_grid()` into the
  envelope / noise-floor border vectors `tE(l)` / `tQ(l)` and the
  Table 4.176 `lA` transient-envelope index: the per-class
  `absBordLead` / `absBordTrail`, the `nRelLead` / `nRelTrail` split,
  FIXFIX's uniform `NINT(numTimeSlots/LE)` spacing, the variable-side
  `2·bs_rel_bord + 2` reconstruction, and the Table 4.174
  `middleBorder` noise-floor split — with strict border monotonicity /
  range validation surfacing `Error::SbrGridInvalid`. Pinned across
  all four frame classes plus the `lA` pointer branches.
- **SBR QMF filterbanks** (`sbr_qmf`) — ISO/IEC 14496-3 §4.6.18.4, the
  first DSP stage of the SBR back-end. The Table 4.A.89 640-tap
  prototype window (transcribed digit-for-digit from the staged spec
  PDF; the table prints `c[639]` with nine decimals, every other entry
  with ten, and the tests pin the `|c[i]| == |c[640-i]|` mirror
  structure), the §4.6.18.4.1 / Figure 4.42 32-band complex analysis
  bank (`AnalysisQmf`, 320-sample history, per-slot
  `W[k] = Σ u[n]·2·exp(iπ/64·(k+0.5)(2n−0.5))`), the §4.6.18.4.2 /
  Figure 4.43 64-band real-output synthesis bank (`SynthesisQmf`,
  1280-sample `v` history, the `g`-extraction / window / ten-tap sum),
  and the §4.6.18.4.3 / Figure 4.44 downsampled 32-channel synthesis
  bank (`DownsampledSynthesisQmf`). A crate-local `Complex` type
  carries the oversampled-by-two complex subband domain. Pinned by
  window spot values + mirror structure, silence/shape guards,
  linearity, a sine through analysis → 64-band synthesis reconstructing
  the 2×-upsampled sine to an error ratio < 1e-4, and analysis →
  downsampled synthesis being a delay-identity at the core rate
  (< 1e-4). New `Error::SbrQmfInvalid` for wrong slot-buffer lengths.

- **SSR gain-control `PFMD` length discipline + cross-frame robustness**
  (`gain_control`) — split the §4.6.12.3.2 `PFMD_B` length into the
  input-read length (`pfmd_len`: 256 for `ONLY_LONG` / `LONG_START`, 32
  for `LONG_STOP` / `EIGHT_SHORT`) and the produced length
  (`pfmd_produced_len`: 256 for `ONLY_LONG` / `LONG_STOP`, 32 for
  `LONG_START` / `EIGHT_SHORT`), which differ because the left-half
  `GMF` region size is sequence-dependent. `GainBandState` now writes
  the produced prefix into a persistent 256-entry buffer so the carry
  never shrinks across a `window_sequence` transition. New tests pin a
  finite, strictly-positive `AD` for all four sequences, the exact
  `AD(j)·GMF(j) == 1` inversion, and the step-3 `ALEV(0)·PFMD` left-half
  scaling.

- **SSR per-channel back-end driver** (`ssr`) — `SsrGainControl`
  composes the four-band gain-control state (`gain_control`) and the
  IPQF synthesizer (`ipqf`) into one persistent per-channel pipeline.
  `decode_frame` takes the four per-band IMDCT outputs `U_{W,B}` plus
  the decoded `gain_control_data()` and runs the §4.6.12.3.3 per-band
  windowing/overlap into `V_B` then the §4.6.12.3.4 IPQF synthesis into
  the PCM `AS(n)` (1024 samples/frame for the steady `ONLY_LONG` /
  `EIGHT_SHORT` case), threading the per-band `PFMD` / `PT` and IPQF
  history across frames. PQF band 0 is never gain-controlled (the
  §4.6.12.3.3 `B == 0` case). The §4.6.12.1 front half (spectrum →
  PQF-band column de-interleave, even-band reversal, the per-band
  IMDCTs) is the caller's responsibility and is tracked as a docs gap
  (the staged §4.6.12 text does not give the spectrum-to-band
  arrangement). Pinned by silence-in/out, the 1024-PCM frame invariant
  for both long and short sequences, the cross-frame overlap carry, and
  a `max_band == 0` ≡ no-gain equivalence.

- **SSR IPQF synthesis filter** (`ipqf`) — ISO/IEC 14496-3 §4.6.12.3.4,
  the inverse polyphase quadrature filter that recombines the four
  per-band gain-controlled sample streams `V_B` into the full-rate PCM
  signal `AS(n)`. Carries the Table 4.110 length-96 prototype `Q(j)`
  (the symmetric `Q(j) = Q(95 − j)` half stored as `Q_HALF`, mirrored by
  `prototype()`), the §4.6.12.3.4 cosine modulation
  `Q_B(j) = Q(j)·cos((2B+1)(2j−3)π/16)`, the 4× upsampling
  `Ṽ_B(j) = V_B(j/4)`, and the streaming convolution
  `AS(n) = Σ_B Σ_j Q_B(j)·Ṽ_B(n−j)` as a polyphase bank (`Ipqf`) that
  retains a 24-deep per-band history across frames. Pinned by the
  prototype-symmetry check, silence-in/silence-out, the 4× output-length
  invariant, and an impulse-response test that matches the streamed
  output to the direct §4.6.12.3.4 convolution `AS(n) = Q_0(n)`.
- **SSR gain-control reconstruction back-end** (`gain_control`) —
  ISO/IEC 14496-3 §4.6.12, the back-end counterpart to the
  `gain_control_data` Table 4.12 wire parser. Implements §4.6.12.3.1
  gain-control data decoding (the Table 4.108 `AdjLoc()` = `8·AC` and
  Table 4.109 `AdjLev()` = `AV − 4` tables, the `NADW` / `ALOC` /
  `ALEV` ladder with the step-(3) `ALOC(0)=0` / `ALEV(0)` and step-(4)
  per-sequence endpoint), §4.6.12.3.2 gain-control function setting
  (the `M_{W,B,j}` index, the `FMD` fragment-modification function with
  the `Inter(a,b,j)` geometric-blend ramp, the per-sequence `GMF`
  composition threading the cross-frame `PFMD`, and the inversion
  `AD(j) = 1/GMF(j)`), and §4.6.12.3.3 gain-control windowing +
  overlapping (`GainBandState::window_overlap`: `T = AD·U`, then the
  per-`window_sequence` overlap-add into the band sample data `V_B`,
  threading the cross-frame `PT_B` tail). All four `window_sequence`
  shapes are covered; the `PFMD ≡ 1.0` / `PT ≡ 0.0` spec initial values
  are honoured. Pinned by table spot-checks, the `Inter` endpoint /
  geometric-midpoint identities, the identity-gain / empty-ladder unit
  cases, and overlap-add property tests.
- **HCR segmentation / pre-sorting scaffold** (`hcr`) — ISO/IEC
  14496-3 §4.6.16.3.3, the deterministic header-only half of Huffman
  codeword reordering: the Table 4.170 `maxCwLen` table (`MAX_CW_LEN`,
  `max_cw_len`), the §4.6.16.3.3.1 `codebookPriority[32]` table
  (`CODEBOOK_PRIORITY`, `codebook_priority`) + the `assignedUnitNr`
  pre-sorting metric (`assigned_unit_nr`), the
  `segmentWidth = min(maxCwLen, length_of_longest_codeword)` derivation
  (`segment_width`), the §4.6.16.3.2 length-field clamps
  (`clamp_longest_codeword`, `clamp_reordered_length` — `6144`
  SCE/CCE/LFE, `12288` CPE), and the `Segmentation` layout that
  instantiates PCW segments until the `length_of_reordered_spectral_data`
  buffer is exhausted, folding the trailing bits into the last segment
  per §4.6.16.3.3.2. The full reordered-payload decode (the PCW /
  non-PCW trial loop) keys off this scaffold and is a later milestone
  (needs an HCR-bearing conformance stream).
- **HCR codeword bit-placement engine** (`hcr::ReorderPlan`,
  `hcr::Direction`) — ISO/IEC 14496-3 §4.6.16.3.3.3 / §4.6.16.3.3.4.
  `ReorderPlan::build(codeword_lengths, segmentation)` runs the
  `ReorderSpectralData()` writing scheme (PCWs written forward from each
  segment start, then the non-PCW set / trial loop with the per-set
  `ToggleWriteDirection()` and the modulo-shift `segment = (trial +
  codewordBase) % numberOfSegments`) to resolve, for each codeword, the
  ordered global buffer bit positions (MSB-first) that carry its bits —
  the geometry a decoder needs to gather a codeword's scattered bits
  back into a contiguous codeword once its length is known. Tested for
  the PCW-at-segment-boundary placement, the backward-direction non-PCW
  fill, multi-segment-spanning codewords, partial-codeword continuation
  across trials, and the bijection invariant (every buffer bit covered
  exactly once). The remaining step binds this geometry to the in-place
  §4.6.3.3 Huffman decode (PCWs first to learn the non-PCW lengths),
  which needs an HCR-bearing conformance stream.
- **Error-resilient `individual_channel_stream()` branch**
  (`ics_body::IcsBody::parse_er` / `::parse_with_ics_info_er`) — ISO/IEC
  14496-3 §4.4.6 Table 4.50, the ER General-Audio object types (AOTs
  17 / 19 / 20 / 23). Drives `section_data()` through the
  [`SectionData::parse_er`] 5-bit branch when
  `aacSectionDataResilienceFlag` is set, `scale_factor_data()` through
  the RVLC [`ErScaleFactorData::parse`] branch when
  `aacScalefactorDataResilienceFlag` is set (mirroring the reconstructed
  records into the shared `scale_factor_data` field so the §4.6.2.3.2
  accumulate pass is branch-agnostic, while the RVLC seeds are retained
  in the new `er_scale_factor_data` field), and captures the
  `length_of_reordered_spectral_data` (14-bit) +
  `length_of_longest_codeword` (6-bit) pair in the new
  `reordered_spectral_lengths` field when `aacSpectralDataResilienceFlag`
  is set. The `reordered_spectral_data()` (HCR) payload that follows is
  the caller's responsibility, exactly as `spectral_data()` is on the
  non-resilient path.
- **Error-resilient `section_data()` branch**
  (`section_data::SectionData::parse_er` / `::write_er`) — ISO/IEC
  14496-3 §4.4.6 Table 4.52, the `aacSectionDataResilienceFlag == 1`
  path: `sect_cb` widens to a 5-bit field (carrying the §4.6.16.4
  virtual codebooks 16..=31), and the `sect_len_incr` escape loop runs
  only for codebooks that use escape coding (`< 11` or `12..=15`) —
  `ESC_HCB` (11) and the virtual codebooks (`>= 16`) take the fixed
  `sect_len_incr = 1` single-band branch with no length field on the
  wire. The recovered `sfb_cb` preserves the raw 5-bit value so the
  virtual→`ESC_HCB` remap can stay one layer up. Round-trips bit-exactly
  through `write_er`; the write path rejects a multi-band fixed-length
  section.
- **CCE per-band coupling math** (`cce::CouplingGains::couple_channel`) —
  ISO/IEC 14496-3 §4.6.8.3.3. The `couple_channel(source, dest,
  gain_list_index)` scale-and-add: walks the spec's group /
  window-group / sfb / coefficient loop, multiplying the embedded-SCE
  spectrum by the per-`(g, sfb)` `cc_gain` and adding it onto a target
  channel's window-major spectrum in place (implicit list 0 in natural
  scaling, `ZERO_HCB` bands skipped), geometry-checked against the
  source / dest length and the embedded SCE's group + band shapes.
  Unit-tested with synthetic spectra (natural scaling, common-gain
  scaling, multi-window short blocks, per-band DPCM gains, geometry
  guard). The decode-loop wiring that applies this onto the addressed
  targets awaits a CCE fixture (docs-gap).
- **`sbr_extension_data()` top-level walker** (`sbr_extension`) —
  ISO/IEC 14496-3 §4.4.2.8 Table 4.62. Ties `sbr_header()` + the
  `sbr_element` framing into a whole SBR extension payload: the
  optional 10-bit `bs_sbr_crc_bits` (`EXT_SBR_DATA_CRC`),
  `bs_header_flag` + `sbr_header()`, `sbr_data(id_aac, bs_amp_res)`
  dispatching onto single / pair elements with band tables derived at
  the SBR internal rate, the threaded previous-header reuse path, and
  the trailing `bs_fill_bits` alignment. Reachable via the new
  `extension_payload::ExtensionPayload::parse_with_sbr` (the default
  `parse` still rejects SBR, so the byte-exact AAC-LC corpus path is
  unchanged). This completes the SBR *bitstream* side-info decode end to
  end; the back-end DSP (QMF / HF patching / envelope adjustment) is
  still pending.
- **Default-config channel reorder** (`channel_map`) — ISO/IEC 14496-3
  §1.6.3.5 / Table 1.19. A new `channel_map` module maps each default
  `channelConfiguration` (1–6) to its canonical
  `oxideav_core::ChannelLayout` and computes the permutation from
  `raw_data_block()` element order to the WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE / BS.775
  interleaved order (e.g. a 5.1 stream's `C, L, R, Ls, Rs, LFE` element
  order becomes `L, R, C, LFE, Ls, Rs`).
  `StreamDecoder::decode_raw_data_block` now takes the signalled
  `channel_configuration` (from the ADTS fixed header and the LATM
  effective ASC) and applies the reorder before interleaving; mono /
  stereo are identity permutations and configs 0 (PCE-defined) / 7
  (amendment-specific 7.1) stay in element order. The existing mono +
  stereo PCM fixtures remain byte-exact (their reorder is a no-op); the
  permutation is pinned by unit tests and end-to-end assembled-frame
  integration tests (`tests/channel_map_reorder.rs`).
- **`coupling_channel_element()` bitstream decode** (`cce`) — ISO/IEC
  14496-3 §4.6.8.3 / Table 4.8. The new `cce` module decodes the CCE
  coupling header (`CouplingHeader`: `ind_sw_cce_flag`,
  `num_coupled_elements`, the per-target `cc_target_is_cpe` /
  `cc_target_tag_select` / `cc_l` / `cc_r` list with the Table 4.153
  shared-vs-split `num_gain_element_lists` derivation, `cc_domain`,
  `gain_element_sign`, `gain_element_scale`) and the trailing gain-list
  loop (`CouplingGains`: per-target `common_gain_element` or per-`(g,
  sfb)` `dpcm_gain_element` running-sum lists, with the §4.6.8.3.3
  `ind_sw_cce_flag ⇒ common-gain-only` constraint and the embedded-SCE
  `sfb_cb` `ZERO_HCB` skip). The gains reuse the §4.A.1 scalefactor
  Huffman codebook (`hcod_sf`) exactly as the spec directs.
  `CouplingGains::cc_gain` applies the §4.6.8.3.3 `couple_channel()`
  scaling `cc_gain = cc_sign · cc_scale^gain` from the Table 4.154
  `cc_scale_table`, with the implicit list-0 natural-scaling target.
  Both `parse` and `write` round-trip; the embedded
  `individual_channel_stream(0,0)` is composed by the caller (as for
  CPE). `CouplingChannelElement::{parse,parse_after_tag}` tie the whole
  Table 4.8 element together (header → embedded `IcsBody` +
  `SpectralData` → gain lists).
- **CCE consumed in the stream decode loop** (`decode`) — a
  `raw_data_block()` carrying a `coupling_channel_element()` no longer
  aborts the whole frame: `StreamDecoder::decode_raw_data_block` now
  fully consumes the CCE via `CouplingChannelElement::parse_after_tag`,
  keeping the walker bit-aligned so the frame's SCE / CPE channels still
  decode. The §4.6.8.3.3 cross-element coupling (scaling the decoded CCE
  spectrum onto the addressed targets) is decoded but not yet applied,
  so the CCE contributes no output channel of its own. Pinned by a
  SCE + CCE + END block test that decodes the SCE byte-identically to
  the same SCE without the trailing CCE.
- **Short-window fixture validation** — the `aac-lc-chirp-windows`
  fixture (a fast frequency sweep that drives `EIGHT_SHORT_SEQUENCE`
  short-window frames through the §4.6.11 eight-short overlap path, with
  §4.6.13 PNS in the upper spectrum) is now under `pcm_byte_exact`'s
  §8 PCM-RMS comparison (error-to-signal ratio 0.046, within a 0.06
  bound). This keeps the short-window decode path under fixture-level
  validation alongside the long-window fixtures.
- **Runtime `Decoder` LOAS routing** (`codec_decoder`) — the registered
  `AacDecoder` now auto-detects its carrier on the first packet (the
  `0xFFF` ADTS syncword vs. the `0x2B7` LOAS `AudioSyncStream`
  syncword) and routes ADTS frames through `StreamDecoder` and LOAS
  packets through the new `LoasDecoder`, threading per-carrier decode
  state across packets. `reset()` re-arms detection; the probe scores a
  bare LOAS syncword at 0.9 (just below a structurally-confirmed ADTS
  hit). A container that hands AAC as a LOAS elementary stream now
  decodes to PCM through the framework trait surface, validated
  bit-identical to the bare `LoasDecoder`.
- **LATM/LOAS → PCM decode driver** (`latm::LoasDecoder`) — ISO/IEC
  14496-3 §1.7.2 / §1.7.3. `LoasDecoder::decode_all` walks a LOAS
  `AudioSyncStream()` byte buffer via the existing
  [`latm::AudioSyncStream`] sync walker, recovers every
  `AudioMuxElement` access unit (`MuxPayload`), and drives each
  payload's §4.4.2.1 `raw_data_block()` through the shared
  `decode::StreamDecoder` core, configuring the decode from the layer's
  `AudioSpecificConfig` (`audioObjectType`, `samplingFrequencyIndex`,
  resolved `sampleRate`). One `StreamDecoder` is held per
  `streamID[prog][lay]` so each multiplexed stream's filterbank
  overlap-add tail / LTP history / predictor state thread
  independently. SBR/PS-configured ASCs are rejected with
  `Error::LatmSbrUnsupported` (no SBR back-end). Validated end to end
  against the `aac-latm-stream` fixture (32 frames, stereo, 44.1 kHz):
  the reconstructed PCM matches the reference WAV to a §8 RMS-error
  ratio of 0.0004 (the only divergence the §4.6.13.3 PNS phase of the
  one NOISE band), and is bit-identical to a hand-fed
  `StreamDecoder::decode_raw_data_block` pass.
- **Transport-independent decode core** (`decode::StreamDecoder::
  decode_raw_data_block`) — the §4.4.2.1 `raw_data_block()` →
  interleaved-PCM walk, factored out of `decode_frame` so it can be
  driven by an explicit `(aot, fs_index, sample_rate,
  num_raw_data_blocks)` configuration. The ADTS path (`decode_frame`)
  now delegates to it; the new LATM driver shares the exact same
  per-element reconstruction chain.
- LATM `StreamMuxConfig()` decode (`latm` module) — ISO/IEC 14496-3
  §1.7.3.1 Table 1.42 plus `LatmGetValue()` (Table 1.43).
  `StreamMuxConfig::parse` decodes the whole multiplex configuration:
  the `audioMuxVersion` / `audioMuxVersionA` version flags (with the
  `audioMuxVersion == 1` `taraBufferFullness` and per-ASC
  length-prefix + `fillBits` extensions), `allStreamsSameTimeFraming`,
  `numSubFrames` / `numProgram` / per-program `numLayer`, the
  per-`streamID[prog][lay]` `LayerConfig` table (each carrying its
  inline `AudioSpecificConfig()` or the resolved `useSameConfig`
  inheritance, the `frameLengthType`, and the type-0
  `latmBufferFullness` / CELP-core `coreFrameOffset` or type-1
  `frameLength`), the `otherDataPresent` / `otherDataLenBits` escape
  loop, and the `crcCheckPresent` / `crcCheckSum`. The `crcCheckSum` is
  recomputed against the configuration prefix via the §1.8.4.5 `CRC8`
  generator (`crc::stream_mux_config_crc`) and a mismatch surfaces
  `Error::LatmCrcMismatch`. The reserved `audioMuxVersionA == 1` branch
  and the CELP/HVXC `frameLengthType` values (`2`..`7`) are rejected
  with dedicated errors.
- LATM `AudioMuxElement()` / `PayloadLengthInfo()` / `PayloadMux()`
  decode (`latm` module) — ISO/IEC 14496-3 §1.7.3.1 Tables 1.41 / 1.44
  / 1.45. `AudioMuxElement::parse` recovers a whole multiplexed
  element: the `muxConfigPresent` `useSameStreamMux` branch (inline
  `StreamMuxConfig()` vs. inherited previous config), the per-subframe
  `PayloadLengthInfo()` + `PayloadMux()` loop over `numSubFrames + 1`
  frames (both the `allStreamsSameTimeFraming` program/layer walk and
  the `numChunk` chunk layout with its `streamIndx` + `AuEndFlag`), the
  `frameLengthType`-0 `MuxSlotLengthBytes` 8-bit-escape byte count and
  the `frameLengthType`-1 fixed `(frameLength + 20) * 8` bits, the
  `otherData` skip, and the trailing `ByteAlign()`. Each recovered
  access unit is returned as a `MuxPayload` carrying the raw bytes for
  the §4.4.2.1 `raw_data_block()` layer.
- LOAS `AudioSyncStream()` / `EPAudioSyncStream()` framing (`latm`
  module) — ISO/IEC 14496-3 §1.7.2.1 Tables 1.36 / 1.37.
  `AudioSyncStream` scans a LOAS byte buffer for the 11-bit `0x2B7`
  syncword, reads the 13-bit `audioMuxLengthBytes`, and decodes the
  byte-aligned `AudioMuxElement(1)` body, exposing an `Iterator` of
  `LoasFrame`s with the `StreamMuxConfig` threaded across frames for
  `useSameStreamMux` inheritance. A body length overrunning the buffer
  is rejected with `Error::LoasSyncInvalid`. `EpAudioSyncHeader::parse`
  decodes the `EPAudioSyncStream` FEC header (`0x4DE1` syncword,
  `futureUse`, `audioMuxLengthBytes`, `frameCounter`, `headerParity`)
  and reports the byte-aligned `EPMuxElement` body offset; the EP-tool
  payload de-interleave is out of scope.
- SBR element framing (`sbr_element` module) — ISO/IEC 14496-3
  §4.4.2.8 Tables 4.65 / 4.66 / 4.74. `SbrElement::parse_single` and
  `SbrElement::parse_pair` decode a whole SBR data element in spec
  order: the optional `bs_data_extra` reserved field, the per-channel
  grid / dtdf / invf / envelope / noise blocks (the coupled-pair
  shared-grid layout vs. the independent-grid layout, with the second
  coupled channel decoded in balance mode), `sbr_sinusoidal_coding()`'s
  `NHigh` add-harmonic flags, and the `bs_extended_data` block (id +
  raw body bytes captured for a later PS pass; `EXTENSION_ID_PS`
  defined). The single-envelope FIXFIX `bs_amp_res` override is applied
  before envelope decode so start-value widths and codebook selection
  match the spec's in-order `bs_amp_res` mutation.
- SBR envelope / noise DPCM reconstruction (`sbr_reconstruct` module) —
  ISO/IEC 14496-3 §4.6.18.3.5. `EnvelopeScalefactors::reconstruct` and
  `NoiseScalefactors::reconstruct` invert the delta coding to recover
  the quantized scalefactors `E_Q(k,l)` / `Q(k,l)` from the raw
  `bs_data_*`: frequency-direction deltas accumulate across bands from
  the absolute start value; time-direction deltas add to the reference
  envelope (the previous envelope in-frame, or the last envelope of the
  prior frame for `l == 0`), including the `i(k)` high↔low band remap
  when the reference resolution differs (`r(l) ≠ g(l)`). The coupled
  second channel's `δ = 0.5` is applied as an integer ×2 on the
  transmitted (even) values. Cross-frame state is threaded via an
  optional previous-frame `prev` argument.
- `sbr_envelope()` / `sbr_noise()` raw decode (`sbr_envelope` module) —
  ISO/IEC 14496-3 §4.4.2.8 Tables 4.72–4.73. `SbrEnvelopeData::parse`
  and `SbrNoiseData::parse` read the per-envelope / per-noise-floor
  delta arrays driven by the grid, the `sbr_dtdf()` delta directions,
  and the derived band counts: a fixed-width absolute start value at
  band 0 of a frequency-coded envelope (5/6/7-bit per the coupling /
  channel / `bs_amp_res` context; noise always 5-bit) followed by
  frequency-direction Huffman deltas, or all-band time-direction
  Huffman deltas. Per-envelope band counts come from `NHigh` / `NLow`,
  noise floors from `NQ`. This produces the raw `bs_data_*` values;
  the §4.6.18.3.5 DPCM accumulation and dequantization are downstream.
- SBR time-frequency grid parsers (`sbr_grid` module) — ISO/IEC
  14496-3 §4.4.2.8 Tables 4.69–4.71. `SbrGrid::parse` decodes all four
  `bs_frame_class` cases (FIXFIX / FIXVAR / VARFIX / VARVAR): the
  envelope count (`2^raw` for FIXFIX, `bs_num_rel_*`-derived otherwise,
  bounded by the §4.6.18.3.6 `SBR_MAX_NUM_ENV`), the variable /
  relative borders, the `ptr_bits = ceil(log2(num_env + 1))`
  `bs_pointer`, the per-envelope frequency-resolution flags (reversed
  for FIXVAR), the single-envelope FIXFIX `bs_amp_res` override, and
  `bs_num_noise = (num_env > 1) ? 2 : 1`. `SbrDtdf::parse` reads the
  per-envelope / per-noise delta-direction flags (Table 4.70), and
  `SbrInvf::parse` the 2-bit inverse-filtering mode per noise band
  (Table 4.71). New `Error::SbrGridInvalid` for a truncated or
  out-of-range grid.
- `sbr_header()` parser (`sbr_header` module) — ISO/IEC 14496-3
  §4.4.2.8 Table 4.63. `SbrHeader::parse` reads the fixed-width header
  (`bs_amp_res` / `bs_start_freq` / `bs_stop_freq` / `bs_xover_band` /
  `bs_reserved` / the two `bs_header_extra_*` flags) and the optional
  extra blocks, filling in the Table 4.63 Note 3 default values
  (Tables 4.105–4.111: `bs_freq_scale=2`, `bs_alter_scale=1`,
  `bs_noise_bands=2`, `bs_limiter_bands=2`, `bs_limiter_gains=2`,
  `bs_interpol_freq=1`, `bs_smoothing_mode=1`) when an extra-header
  flag is clear. `band_geometry_changed()` reports whether the
  §4.6.18.3.3 band-reset parameters differ between two headers, and
  `derive_bands()` chains the header into the existing
  `sbr_freq_bands` k0/k2/master/HiLoTables pipeline.
- SBR Huffman codebooks + `sbr_huff_dec()` (`sbr_huffman` module) —
  ISO/IEC 14496-3 Annex 4.A.6.1. All ten normative SBR envelope /
  noise codebooks (Tables 4.A.79–4.A.88) are transcribed directly from
  the spec codeword grids: `t/f_huffman_env_1_5dB` (LAV 60),
  `t/f_huffman_env_bal_1_5dB` (LAV 24), `t/f_huffman_env_3_0dB` (LAV
  31), `t/f_huffman_env_bal_3_0dB` (LAV 12), `t_huffman_noise_3_0dB`
  (LAV 31), `t_huffman_noise_bal_3_0dB` (LAV 12). The
  frequency-direction noise codebooks alias the 3.0 dB envelope freq
  tables per Table 4.A.78 Note 2. `sbr_huff_dec()` reads MSB-first one
  bit at a time and returns `index - LAV` (the signed DPCM delta);
  `env_tables()` / `noise_tables()` pick the `(t_huff, f_huff)` pair
  from an `SbrHuffContext` (`bs_coupling` / channel / `bs_amp_res`) per
  the §4.6.18.3 `sbr_envelope()` / `sbr_noise()` selection. Every table
  is validated complete + prefix-free, and a codeword round-trip test
  exercises all entries. New `Error::SbrHuffInvalid` for an unmatched
  or truncated codeword.

- Runtime `oxideav_core::Decoder` wiring (`codec_decoder` module) — the
  no-op `register()` now installs a real AAC decoder under id `"aac"`.
  `AacDecoder` adapts the persistent `decode::StreamDecoder` into the
  framework's packet-in / frame-out trait: `send_packet` decodes every
  ADTS frame in a packet (ID3v2-skip + `aac_frame_length` framing, one
  or more frames per packet) against the carried-across-packets element
  state, `receive_frame` returns one interleaved-S16 `AudioFrame` (1024
  samples/channel) per decoded frame, `flush` drives to `Eof`, and
  `reset` drops the whole `StreamDecoder` (and with it the §4.6.11
  overlap / §4.6.7 LTP / §4.6.6 predictor memory) for a clean post-seek
  restart. `register_codecs` claims the MP4 object-type `0x40`,
  WAVEFORMATEX `0x00FF` / `0x1601`, the `mp4a` / `aac ` FourCCs, and the
  Matroska `A_AAC` CodecID, with an ADTS-syncword probe to win shared
  tags. A `trait_decode_matches_stream_decoder_pcm` test pins the trait
  output as byte-identical to the underlying `StreamDecoder`. No encoder
  is wired (the crate has the bit-exact wire writers but no rate-control
  back-end). New `tests/codec_decoder_pcm.rs` re-runs the
  `expected.wav` corpus comparison through the framework trait surface
  (packet-in / `AudioFrame`-out, the exact path a container drives):
  the two PNS-free fixtures stay **≥99.9% byte-exact, max error 1 LSB**,
  and the PNS fixtures stay below the §8 PCM-RMS tolerance — proving the
  packetisation / `AudioFrame` byte-layout / across-packet state
  threading preserve the underlying decode. A
  `he_aac_base_layer_decodes_through_trait` test pins that an HE-AAC v1
  ADTS stream (AAC-LC base layer + an `EXT_SBR_DATA` extension this
  crate has no back-end for) still decodes its base layer to PCM through
  the trait rather than erroring — the §4.4.2.1 walk consumes the FIL
  element and the SBR high band is simply absent.

- Stream-level ADTS decode driver (`decode` module) — the §4.4.2.1
  `raw_data_block()` walk above the per-element driver. `StreamDecoder`
  holds one `ElementDecoder` per `(syntactic-element-id,
  element_instance_tag)` slot so each element's §4.6.11 overlap, §4.6.7
  LTP history, and §4.6.6 predictor state persist across frames;
  `decode_frame` dispatches each `id_syn_ele` (SCE / LFE / CPE, including
  the §4.4.2.3 `common_window` / `ms_mask_present` header for a CPE) onto
  the matching slot and renders the frame's channels to element-order
  interleaved 16-bit PCM via the new `pcm` module, and `decode_all`
  walks a whole raw-ADTS buffer (ID3v2-skip + `aac_frame_length`
  framing) to a `Vec<DecodedFrame>`. With this driver the crate decodes
  a raw ADTS stream end to end to comparable s16 PCM. CCE / multi-RDB /
  SBR remain out of scope (the element driver's limits). New
  `tests/pcm_byte_exact.rs` compares the decoded PCM against each
  fixture's `expected.wav` in two regimes: the two PNS-free fixtures
  (`aac-lc-mono-8000-16kbps-adts`, `aac-lc-intensity-stereo`) match the
  reference s16 output at **99.9% byte-exact, max error 1 LSB** (the
  residual being the f64-direct-sum vs float32-fast-transform IMDCT
  difference); the six PNS-bearing fixtures are compared in the
  §8-prescribed PCM RMS domain, where the error-to-signal RMS ratio
  stays **below 0.1%** (the spec-undefined §4.6.13.3 noise phase carries
  negligible energy in these tonal fixtures, so full byte-exactness is
  precluded but the decode is energetically near-identical). A third
  test pins that a `StreamDecoder` decodes a PNS-heavy stream
  reproducibly across runs (the determinism the open §4.6.13.3 generator
  still must provide).
- §4.6.11 integer-PCM rendering (`pcm` module) — the final output stage
  that turns the §4.6.11 filterbank's `f64` time signal (already on the
  `±32768` full-scale amplitude axis from the `2/N` IMDCT normalisation +
  §4.6.2.3.3 scalefactor gain) into 16-bit signed PCM. `nint` is the
  §1.3 `NINT()` nearest-integer operator (half-integers rounded away from
  zero, per the spec arithmetic-operator definitions); `to_s16` applies
  it then saturates to `-32768..=32767`; `channel_to_s16` maps a channel
  and `interleave_s16` packs a frame's per-channel buffers into the
  element-order interleaved layout. The conversion is the *only*
  output-rendering step (no resampler, no dither, no channel remap), so
  it is fully spec-determined. New `Error::PcmInvalid` for a channel
  length disagreement on interleave. Pinned by 9 unit tests
  (away-from-zero half rounding, non-finite-to-zero, saturation extremes,
  interleave order / mismatch). This unblocks `expected.wav` byte-exact
  comparison: the deterministic (non-PNS) decode path now matches the
  reference s16 output to within ≤1 LSB (the residual is the difference
  between this crate's f64 direct-sum IMDCT and a float32 fast transform;
  PNS bands diverge by the §4.6.13.3 spec-undefined RNG phase, as
  expected).
- §1.8.4.5 error-protection CRC generator (`crc` module) — the full
  family of MPEG-4 Audio CRC generation polynomials (`CrcPoly::Crc4`
  through `Crc32`, including the `Crc8` used by the LATM
  `StreamMuxConfig()` `crcCheckSum` and the 16-bit `x¹⁶+x¹⁵+x²+1`),
  with `width()` / `generator()` accessors derived directly from the
  §1.8.4.5 polynomial listing. `crc_bits` / `crc_bytes` implement the
  zero-init, MSB-first, no-input-reflection shift register computing
  the §1.8.4.5 `M(x)·xᵏ = Q(x)·G(x) + R(x)` remainder and apply the
  normative output-bit inversion ("the CRC bits are written in a
  reversed manner, i.e. each bit is inverted"). `stream_mux_config_crc`
  is the LATM `crcCheckSum` (§1.7.3.1 / Table 1.42) helper. Validated
  against an independent GF(2) long-division reference across six
  widths and the `M(x)·xᵏ + R(x)` codeword-divisibility property. The
  §1.8.4.6 SRCPC FEC stage and the ADTS `adts_error_check()`
  region-selection CRC (ISO/IEC 13818-7 → ISO/IEC 11172-3 §2.4.3.1)
  are out of scope.
- §4.6.18.3.2 SBR frequency band tables (`sbr_freq_bands` module) — the
  static, header-only half of the Spectral Band Replication band setup,
  computed from the closed-form ISO/IEC 14496-3 algorithm with no QMF
  back-end. `k0` / `k2` derive the §4.6.18.3.2.1 low / high QMF subband
  boundaries (the per-`FsSBR` `offset` table, the
  `startMin`/`stopMin = NINT(c·128/FsSBR)` thresholds, the
  `stopDkSort` accumulation for `bs_stop_freq < 14`, and the
  `bs_stop_freq == 14/15` `min(64, 2·k0)` / `min(64, 3·k0)`
  shortcuts). `master_table` builds `fMaster` for both the Figure 4.39
  linear path (`bs_freq_scale == 0`) and the Figure 4.40 warped path
  (`bs_freq_scale > 0`, single-/two-region split at `k2/k0 > 2.2449`
  with the `min(vDk1) < max(vDk0)` smoothing). `HiLoTables::derive`
  produces the §4.6.18.3.2.2 `fTableHigh` / `fTableLow` / `fTableNoise`
  plus the `M` and `k_x` outputs. The §4.6.18.3.6 requirements
  (`k2 > k0`, `numBands > 0`, `vDk > 0`, `bs_xover_band < NMaster`) are
  enforced via the new `Error::SbrFreqBandInvalid`. The §4.6.18.3.2.3
  limiter band table is deferred (needs the §4.6.18.6 patch borders).
- §4.6.6 MPEG-2 frequency-domain prediction (`predictor` module) — the
  backward-adaptive intra-channel predictor of the AAC Main object type
  (AOT 1). A `PredictorBank` of second-order lattice `Predictor`s (one
  per MDCT line up to the §4.6.6.2 `PRED_SFB_MAX` limit) reconstructs
  `x_rec = x_est + y_rec` on the signalled bands. Implements the
  §4.6.6.3.2.1 lattice `predict()` + LMS adaptation (`α = 0.90625`,
  `a = b = 0.953125`), the §4.6.6.3.2.3 `flt_round_inf()` 16-bit-float
  rounding applied to every stored state variable and the predicted
  value, and the §4.6.6.3.3 reset (the 30 Table 4.97 cyclic groups plus
  the short-block reset-all). Wired into `element_decode`: each channel
  now carries a lazily-built per-rate predictor bank, run every long
  frame *before* §4.6.7 LTP / §4.6.9 TNS and reset on a short block, so
  the backward-adaptive state persists across frames. Prediction and LTP
  are mutually exclusive by object type. New `Error::PredictorInvalid`
  for an inconsistent offset table / spectrum length / reset-group
  number.
- §4.6.7.4.1 LTP-with-TNS integration — LTP is now wired into the
  `element_decode` driver in the Figure 4.30 block order.
  `finish_channel` runs long-term synthesis *before* the §4.6.9 TNS
  synthesis filter, with the LTP-predicted spectrum `X_est` first passed
  through the matching all-zero **TNS analysis filter** so the
  `X_rec = X_est + Y_rec` add is like-for-like; the subsequent TNS
  synthesis pass shapes the residual while undoing the analysis on the
  LTP contribution. `ElementDecoder` now holds a per-channel
  `ltp::LtpState`, advanced every frame (whether or not LTP fired) via
  the filterbank's new `aliased_tail()` / `prev_shape()` accessors so
  the §4.6.7.3 reconstruction history stays continuous. New
  `tns_coef::tns_ma_filter` (the all-zero inverse of the §4.6.9.3
  `tns_ar_filter`) and `tns_frame::tns_analysis_frame` (its per-window
  frame driver); `ltp::LtpState::apply_long_with_analysis` inserts the
  analysis filter between `MDCT(x_est)` and the per-sfb add.
  Short-window LTP and the ER AAC LD `M = N/2` lag offset remain out of
  scope. Pinned by analysis∘synthesis identity tests and three
  element-level LTP tests (zero-history no-op, second-frame divergence,
  LTP+TNS finiteness).

- §4.6.7 Long-Term Prediction (LTP) long-window synthesis (`ltp`): the
  Table 4.98 coefficient codebook, the `predict()` single-tap
  time-domain predictor over the §4.6.7.3 `x_rec` reconstruction
  history (`x_est(i) = ltp_coef·x_rec(i − ltp_lag)`), the windowed
  analysis `MDCT(x_est)`, and the per-sfb `X_rec = X_est + Y_rec`
  spectral combination on the bands flagged by `ltp_long_used`. The
  forward (analysis) MDCT (§4.6.15.3.3 / §4.6.11.3.1) is promoted to a
  reusable `filterbank` primitive. Short-window and ER AAC LD (`M =
  N/2`) LTP remain out of scope; the side info was already parsed.

- add §4.6.9.3 tns_ar_filter all-pole IIR pass

### Added

- phase 2 (r311): `element_decode` — the element-level decode driver,
  the §4.6 block-order glue that chains every per-tool primitive into
  PCM-domain samples for a `single_channel_element()` (SCE / LFE) and a
  `channel_pair_element()` (CPE). `ElementDecoder` is stateful: it holds
  one `Filterbank` per channel slot (the §4.6.11.3.3 overlap-add tail
  and §4.6.11.3.2 previous-block window shape persist across frames) and
  the §4.6.13.3 PNS generator state. `decode_sce` runs pulse §4.6.3.3 →
  dequant §4.6.1.3 → rescale §4.6.2.3.3 → `quant_to_spec()` §4.6.3.3 →
  PNS §4.6.13 → TNS §4.6.9 → filterbank §4.6.11. `decode_cpe` runs the
  pair chain with the joint-stereo / noise tools in normative block
  order — per-channel pulse/dequant/de-interleave, then M/S §4.6.8.1 →
  intensity §4.6.8.2 → PNS §4.6.13 on the pre-TNS pair (the tools sit
  between `quant_to_spec()` and TNS per §4.6.13.5), then per-channel TNS
  + filterbank. `ChannelInput` bundles a parsed body + `ics_info` +
  spectrum; `CpeJointStereo` carries the Table 4.4 `ms_mask_present` +
  `ms_used`. New `Error::ElementDecodeInvalid` covers a CPE with
  mismatched window geometry, an under-covered `ms_used` mask, or a
  scalefactor-record count that does not match the `sfb_cb`
  non-`ZERO_HCB` band count. Pinned by 9 unit tests (band-indexed track
  expansion, SCE finite/non-silent PCM, inter-frame overlap coupling,
  CPE M/S reconstruction, mask-off independence, window-mismatch
  rejection, single-channel noise synthesis) and an end-to-end
  integration driver (`tests/element_decode.rs`) that decodes all 12
  staged ADTS fixtures to PCM with finite output, non-silent frames, and
  witnessed overlap coupling. The Main predictor (§4.6.7), LTP
  (§4.6.6), and SSR gain-control (§4.6.12) remain unapplied;
  `expected.wav` PCM comparison is a followup.
- phase 2 (r307): `pns` — the §4.6.13 Perceptual Noise Substitution
  synthesis, the third and last channel-pair / noise tool. `apply_pns`
  fills every `NOISE_HCB` (13) band of a channel in place over a
  `PnsChannel` (the de-interleaved window-major spectrum, the per-band
  `sfb_cb`, and the accumulated `noise_nrg[g][sfb]`) by drawing a
  random vector and applying the 2009 measured-energy normalisation
  `scale = 2^(0.25·noise_nrg) / sqrt(Σ spec²)`, so each band's L2 norm
  is exactly `2^(0.25·noise_nrg)` — a deterministic, spec-determined
  invariant (only the per-coefficient phase is generator-dependent,
  which §4.6.13.3 leaves open). Public `noise_target_norm`, `is_noise`,
  and the default `gen_rand_vector` generator; `apply_pns` takes the
  generator as a closure. `apply_pns_pair` implements the §4.6.13.3
  shared-random-vector correlation rule for a channel pair (same vector
  for both channels when both are noise on a band and the band signals
  correlation; independent otherwise; no M/S de-matrix on noise bands,
  §4.6.13.5). Runs prior to TNS in the §4.6 block order. New
  `Error::PnsInvalid`. With PNS landed, all three channel-pair / noise
  tools (M/S, intensity, PNS) are synthesised.
- phase 2 (r300): `intensity_stereo` — the §4.6.8.2 intensity stereo
  (IS) synthesis, the second deterministic channel-pair tool.
  `apply_intensity_stereo` derives the right channel from the left in
  place over an `IntensityPairSpectra` (the pair's de-interleaved
  window-major spectra, the right `sfb_cb`, and its accumulated
  `is_pos[g][sfb]`), for every `(group, window, sfb)` whose right
  codebook is an intensity book, via the §4.6.8.2.3 scale
  `is_intensity · invert_intensity · 0.5^(0.25·is_pos)` — left channel
  untouched. Public helpers `is_intensity` (`+1`/`−1`/`0` for
  `INTENSITY_HCB` / `INTENSITY_HCB2` / other), `invert_intensity`
  (`1 − 2·ms_used` under a per-band M/S mask, the §4.6.8.2.3 phase
  reversal; `+1` otherwise), and `intensity_gain` (`0.5^(0.25·is_pos)`).
  Runs after M/S and before TNS in the §4.6 block order. Pinned by an
  encode→decode round-trip over a 20-band long frame plus unit tests
  for the sign, both invert branches, the gain ladder, in/out-of-phase
  copy, position scaling, mask-on/off phase distinction, short-window
  grouping, and the shape-validation rejections. New
  `Error::IntensityStereoInvalid`. PNS (§4.6.13) is the remaining
  channel-pair / noise tool.
- phase 2 (r293): `ms_stereo` — the §4.6.8.1 M/S (mid/side) stereo
  de-matrix, the first of the channel-pair / noise synthesis tools
  between the round-289 single-channel chain and byte-exact PCM.
  `apply_ms_stereo` runs the §4.6.8.1.3 inverse matrix
  (`l' = m + s`, `r' = m − s`) in place over a `ChannelPairSpectra`
  (both channels' de-interleaved, pre-TNS window-major spectra plus
  per-channel `sfb_cb`), per `(group, window, sfb)` selected by the
  decoded `MsMaskPresent` (`00` no-op / `01` per-band `ms_used` mask /
  `10` all-ones; `11` reserved → rejected). Suppressed on
  intensity-coded bands (right-channel `INTENSITY_HCB` /
  `INTENSITY_HCB2`) and noise-substituted bands (`NOISE_HCB` in either
  channel), keeping M/S mutually exclusive with intensity and PNS.
  Pinned by an encode→decode round-trip over a 20-band long frame plus
  unit tests for all three mask modes, the intensity / noise
  exclusions, short-window grouping, exact integer invertibility, and
  the shape-validation paths. New `Error::MsStereoInvalid` covers
  channel-pair / `ms_used` / `sfb_cb` shapes that disagree with the
  shared `common_window` `ics_info` geometry.
- phase 2 (r289): `filterbank` — the §4.6.11 filterbank and block
  switching, the time-domain reconstruction stage that consumes the
  round-284 window-major decoded spectrum and emits PCM-domain
  samples. `Filterbank::synthesize` runs the §4.6.11.3.1 IMDCT
  (`x[n] = (2/N)·Σ spec[k]·cos((2π/N)(n + n0)(k + 1/2))`,
  `n0 = (N/2 + 1)/2`, `N ∈ {2048, 256}`), applies the §4.6.11.3.2
  sine and Kaiser-Bessel-derived windows for all four
  `window_sequence` shapes (`ONLY_LONG` / `LONG_START` /
  `EIGHT_SHORT` / `LONG_STOP`) — with the left-half shape inherited
  from the previous block — and performs the §4.6.11.3.3 inter-frame
  overlap-add, carried across frames as stateful overlap. The KBD
  window is the normalized running sum of the Kaiser-Bessel kernel
  `W'(n, α)` (`α = 4` long, `α = 6` short) over a power-series `I0`.
  Pinned by streaming TDAC perfect-reconstruction tests (sine + KBD,
  long + eight-short), `W(n)^2 + W(n + N/2)^2 = 1` window-power
  identities, tabulated `I0` values, and a mono-ADTS-fixture
  integration driver that confirms finite PCM with the overlap tail
  coupling consecutive frames. New `Error::FilterbankInvalid` covers
  spectrum-length / `window_sequence` mismatches. The frame-length-960
  (`N = 1920 / 240`) transform family is out of scope, matching the
  crate's 1024-coefficient `swb_offset` layout.
- phase 2 (r284): `dequant` + `decoded_spectrum` — the first numeric
  reconstruction stages after the wire walk, ending one step short of
  the §4.6.11 filterbank. `dequant::inverse_quantize` is the
  §4.6.1.3 non-uniform inverse quantizer
  (`Sign(x_quant) · |x_quant|^(4/3)`, computed as `|x| · cbrt(|x|)`
  so perfect cubes invert exactly); `dequant::scale_factor_gain` is
  the §4.6.2.3.3 `get_scale_factor_gain()`
  (`2^(0.25 · (sf − SF_OFFSET))`, `SF_OFFSET = 100`);
  `dequant::rescale_spectrum` applies both band-wise over the
  §4.5.2.3.4 `sect_sfb_offset` ranges directly in the §4.5.2.3.5
  interleaved transmission order, consuming the
  `scale_factor_data::accumulate` absolute records in wire-order
  lockstep with `sfb_cb` (PNS / intensity records are consumed but
  produce silence — their §4.6.13 / §4.6.8 synthesis is a later
  tool). `decoded_spectrum::quant_to_spec` is the §4.6.3.3
  de-interleaver from group-interleaved order to the window-major
  `spec[w][k]` layout TNS / the filterbank consume;
  `decoded_spectrum::decode_channel_spectrum` composes the full
  per-channel stage — §4.6.3.3 pulse fix-up on `x_quant` →
  scalefactor accumulation → inverse quantization + rescaling →
  `quant_to_spec()` → §4.6.9 `tns_decode_frame`. New
  `Error::DequantInvalid` / `Error::QuantToSpecInvalid` cover the
  structural rejections. 16 unit tests (hand-derived spec-formula
  vectors: exact cubes, exact power-of-two gains, grouped-short
  shared gains, layout rejections) + 5 pipeline integration tests
  (`tests/decoded_spectrum.rs`: stage-composition equivalence,
  pulse-before-dequant ordering, TNS-stage equivalence) + the new
  `tests/docs_adts_corpus.rs` structural driver that walks all 12
  staged ADTS fixtures frame-by-frame (ADTS header →
  `raw_data_block()` walk → SCE / LFE / CPE bodies including the
  Table 4.4 `common_window` / `ms_mask_present` header →
  `spectral_data()` → pipeline) and asserts every decoded spectrum
  is finite with plausible energy (skips cleanly when `docs/` is
  absent in standalone-repo CI).
- phase 2 (r281): `spectral_data` — the ISO/IEC 14496-3 Table 4.56
  `spectral_data()` wire walker plus its bit-exact writer, the §4.4.6
  driver the codebook rounds were building toward. `SpectralData::
  parse` loops over the window groups and sections established by
  `ics_info()` / `section_data()`, dispatches per section onto the
  Codebook 1..=11 Huffman decoders, applies the §4.6.3.3
  `quad_sign_bits` / `pair_sign_bits` suffix on unsigned books, and
  reconstructs ESC-book magnitudes ≥ 16 from the `hcod_esc_y` /
  `hcod_esc_z` escape sequences (`2^(N+4) + escape_word`, capped at
  `MAX_QUANT` per §4.6.1.3). Loop bounds come from the new public
  `sect_sfb_offset()` helper implementing the §4.5.2.3.4 derivation
  (long windows mirror `swb_offset_long_window`; eight-short groups
  scale the short-window band widths by `window_group_length[g]`).
  Coefficients are surfaced per group in the §4.5.2.3.5 transmission
  (interleaved) order; the `quant_to_spec()` deinterleave into the
  window-major layout TNS/the filterbank consume is the next tool.
  `SpectralData::write` is the symmetric inverse (ESC clamping to the
  in-band `ESC_FLAG`, sign-bit derivation, escape re-encoding). New
  `Error::SpectralDataInvalid` / `Error::SpectralDataEncodeInvalid`
  cover the structural and encode-side rejections (reserved codebook
  12, `max_sfb > num_swb`, group-count/buffer-shape mismatches,
  non-zero coefficients in spectrum-less bands). 20 unit tests
  (`src/spectral_data.rs`) + 9 integration tests
  (`tests/spectral_data.rs`), including an `IcsBody` → `SpectralData`
  composition that parses a complete Table 4.50 channel-element body
  from one reader.
- phase 2 (r278): `tns_frame::tns_decode_frame` — the ISO/IEC
  14496-3 §4.6.9.3 per-frame TNS orchestration. Chains the
  `tns_data` wire parser, `tns_coef::tns_decode_coef_to_lpc`, and
  `tns_coef::tns_ar_filter` per the spec pseudocode: top-down
  region slicing from `bottom = num_swb` in units of scalefactor
  bands, `TNS_MAX_ORDER` clamping of the wire `order` (only the
  first `tns_order` magnitudes participate), the three-way
  `min(band, TNS_MAX_BANDS, max_sfb)` band clamp through the
  `swb_offset` tables, and direction-dependent upward/downward
  strided walks over each window's slice of the dequantised
  spectrum. Order-0 filters and fully-clamped regions are the
  pseudocode's `continue` no-ops. New `Error::TnsFrameInvalid`
  covers frame-level precondition violations (spectrum length ≠
  `num_windows × window_len`, window-count mismatch, `coef`
  shorter than the clamped order); `swb_offset` / `TNS_MAX_BANDS`
  coverage and wire-magnitude errors propagate unchanged. ER AAC
  LD 480/512-line frames stay deferred with the standing
  `int_tns_decode_coef()` deferral. The complete §4.6.9 TNS decode
  tool — wire parse → coefficient decode → region slicing →
  in-place filtering — is now in place. 18 unit tests
  (`src/tns_frame.rs`) + 5 wire-round-trip integration tests
  (`tests/tns_frame.rs`).

### Added

  §4.6.9.3 `tns_ar_filter()` all-pole (auto-regressive) IIR pass.
  Runs the spec recurrence `y(n) = x(n) − lpc[1]·y(n−1) − … −
  lpc[order]·y(n−order)` in place over a strided region of the
  dequantised MDCT spectrum, consuming the direct-form `lpc[]` array
  produced by [`tns_coef::tns_decode_coef_to_lpc`]. Filter state is
  zero-seeded at every invocation, the output overwrites the input,
  and the strided walk honours both the upward (`inc = +1`) and the
  downward (`inc = −1`, `start = end − 1`) directions that
  §4.6.9.3 `tns_decode_frame` sets from the per-filter `direction`
  flag. An empty `lpc`, an `inc ∉ {−1, +1}`, or a `start`/`size`/`inc`
  triple whose strided walk leaves the spectrum bounds is rejected
  with [`Error::TnsCoefOutOfRange`]; an order-0 filter (`lpc ==
  [1.0]`) and a zero-length region are well-defined no-ops. With the
  inverse-quantisation + LPC step-up from r263, both TNS building
  blocks the §4.6.9 `tns_decode_frame` orchestration chains are now
  in place; only the `swb_offset` / grouping region slicer (which
  needs the per-frame spectral context) remains. 10 new unit tests
  (`src/tns_coef.rs`): order-0 identity, hand-checked order-1 impulse
  response, order-2/3 cross-checks against an independent reference
  recurrence, the downward-walk equivalence, region-isolation
  (sentinel-padded buffer), and the four argument-validation
  rejections, plus an end-to-end wire-`coef` → LPC → filter path.

- phase 2 (r263): `tns_coef` module — ISO/IEC 14496-3 §4.6.9.3
  `tns_decode_coef` inverse-quantisation and conversion-to-LPC
  step-up procedure, plus the §C.6 encoder-side companion
  `tns_encode_coef`. This is the bridge between the
  [`tns_data`](src/tns_data.rs) wire parser (which surfaces the
  unsigned-magnitude `coef[i]` field as transmitted, packed into
  `coef_res2 ∈ {2, 3, 4}` bits per the `coef_res[w] +
  3 − coef_compress` arithmetic) and the eventual `tns_ar_filter()`
  all-pole IIR pass that operates on the reconstructed MDCT
  spectrum. The decode path follows the §4.6.9.3 pseudocode literally:
  the wire `coef[i]` is sign-extended via the §4.6.9.3 `sgn_mask` /
  `neg_mask` pair (equivalent to a two's-complement extension of the
  truncated `coef_res2`-bit field), then inverse-quantised via
  `sin(tmp[i] / iqfac_branch)` where the divisor branches on the sign
  of the sign-extended index: `iqfac = ((1 << (coef_res_bits-1)) -
  0.5) / (π/2)` for non-negative indices and `iqfac_m = ((1 <<
  (coef_res_bits-1)) + 0.5) / (π/2)` for negative indices. The
  half-bit offset matches the §C.6 encoder's rounded
  `NINT(arcsin(r) * iqfac_branch)` quantisation so every legal wire
  value round-trips through decode → encode bit-exactly (35 wire
  patterns across all four `(coef_res_bits, coef_compress)`
  combinations, enumerated at unit-test time). The §4.6.9.3
  conversion-to-LPC step-up loop is implemented as [`lpc_step_up`]:
  it takes the inverse-quantised PARCOR array and produces the
  `order + 1` direct-form LPC `a[]` vector with `a[0] = 1.0` and
  `a[order] = parcor[order-1]`, with intermediate slots derived by
  the spec's `b[i] = a[i] + k * a[m-i]` cross-term recurrence
  (validated against hand-arithmetic at orders 1, 2, and 3). The
  combined wrapper [`tns_decode_coef_to_lpc`] runs both passes for
  the eventual `tns_decode_frame()` orchestration. Encoder-side
  saturation: `r = ±1.0` rounds to `±NINT(π/2 * iqfac_branch)` and
  clamps to the `coef_res2`-bit signed field extrema (`±7` /
  `±8`-clamped-to-`+7,-8` at `coef_res2 = 4`). Public API:
  [`iqfac`] / [`iqfac_m`] (the §4.6.9.3 scaling constants),
  [`sign_extend_coef`] / [`pack_coef`] (signed-magnitude wire ↔
  signed integer), [`tns_decode_coef`] / [`tns_encode_coef`] (the
  full inverse-quantisation surface), [`lpc_step_up`] (the §4.6.9.3
  conversion-to-LPC second loop), and [`tns_decode_coef_to_lpc`]
  (the combined wrapper). Argument-validation errors all surface as
  the new [`Error::TnsCoefOutOfRange`] variant: invalid
  `coef_res_bits` (anything outside `{3, 4}`), `coef_compress > 1`,
  wire `coef[i]` that overflows the `coef_res2`-bit field, encode
  PARCOR values `|r| > 1.0` (or NaN / ±∞ — `arcsin` undefined), or
  `pack_coef` values outside the field-representable signed range.

  `tns_ar_filter` per (window, filter) lands once the IMDCT
  back-end is present. The §4.6.17.3.4 ER AAC LD
  `int_tns_decode_coef()` integer variant is deferred until the LD

  / Annex 4.A Table 4.A.12 (Spectrum Huffman Codebook 11) wire layer.
  Codebook 11 is the only **ESC** spectrum book — Table 4.95 row 11
  declares `unsigned_cb = 1`, `dim = 2`, `LAV = 16` with an ESC
  threshold of `8191` (the §4.6.1.3 `x_quant` ceiling). The §4.6.3.3
  in-band universe widens to a `17 × 17 = 289`-entry lattice indexed
  `0..=288` with each `(y, z)` coefficient in `0..=16`; a coefficient
  value of `16` in either slot is the `escape_flag` whose actual
  magnitude is reconstructed from the `escape_sequence` bridged by
  `crate::spectral_codebook::decode_esc_value` /
  `crate::spectral_codebook::encode_esc_value` (round 213) — separate
  from the Huffman codeword carried by this module. The §4.6.3.3
  unsigned polynomial `idx = y * 17 + z` parks the zero-tuple `(0, 0)`
  at index 0 with the shortest 4-bit codeword `0b0000`, shares that
  4-bit floor with the interior `(1, 1)` pair at index 18 (codeword
  `0b0001`), pins the half-ESC tuples `(0, 16)` and `(16, 0)` to
  10-bit `0x38e` (index 16) and 9-bit `0x1c2` (index 272), and parks
  the full-ESC corner `(16, 16)` at index 288 with the 5-bit `0b00100`
  (`0x04`) — the wire layout extends with two sign bits and two
  escape sequences for that corner, so the in-band Huffman codeword
  stays short. The codeword ceiling matches Codebook 10's 12 bits —
  exactly six rows reach it (indices 12, 14, 15, 255, 269, 270 with
  codewords `0xffb`, `0xffa`, `0xffe`, `0xffd`, `0xffc`, `0xfff`) —
  because Codebook 11 pushes its tail distribution into the §4.6.3
  ESC sequence rather than spending longer Huffman codewords on it.
  Public constants `HCOD11_NUM_ENTRIES = 289`, `HCOD11_MAX_LEN = 12`.
  Public functions `hcod11_encode(idx) -> (length, codeword)`
  (right-aligned in `u16`), `hcod11_decode(reader) -> idx` (MSB-first
  prefix match, linear scan against the 289-row table), and the
  convenience writer `hcod11_write(writer, idx)`. Out-of-range indices
  (`idx > 288`) surface as `Error::SpectralCodebookIndexOutOfRange(11)`;
  the decoder surfaces `Error::UnexpectedEnd` on reader underflow. The
  table is a **complete** prefix code (Kraft equality
  `Σ 2^(12 − L) = 4096 = 2^12`), exhaustively verified by walking
  every 12-bit prefix at unit-test time and asserting each maps to
  exactly one entry — so the decoder's `unreachable!()` fall-through
  is dead by construction. Adds 20 new unit tests and 30 new

- phase 2 (r255): `spectrum_huffman::HCOD10` — ISO/IEC 14496-3 §4.6.3
  / Annex 4.A Table 4.A.11 (Spectrum Huffman Codebook 10) wire layer.
  Codebook 10 is the second **expanded-LAV unsigned pair** spectrum
  book — Table 4.95 row 10 mirrors row 9 column-for-column
  (`unsigned_cb = 1`, `dim = 2`, `LAV = 12`) so the §4.6.3.3 universe
  is the same `13 × 13 = 169`-entry lattice indexed `0..=168` with
  each `(y, z)` coefficient in `0..=12`. Codebook 10 differs from
  Codebook 9 in its codeword-length distribution: where Codebook 9
  parks the §4.6.3.3 zero-tuple `(0, 0)` at index 0 with a single-bit
  `0` codeword and lets the rarest pair magnitudes reach a 15-bit
  ceiling, Codebook 10 lifts the zero-tuple at index 0 to a 6-bit
  `0b100010` (`0x22`), migrates the shortest 4-bit slot onto the
  interior `(1, 1)` tuple at index 14 with codeword `0b0000`, and
  pulls the codeword ceiling down to **12 bits** — the same head-
  displacement pattern Codebook 8 uses relative to Codebook 7 at the
  narrower `LAV = 7` universe. Exactly three rows reach the 4-bit
  floor (indices 14, 15, 27) and exactly eight rows reach the 12-bit
  ceiling (indices 12, 129, 142, 155, 165, 166, 167, 168), reflecting
  an encoder target whose magnitude statistics put more weight in the
  `(1..=4, 1..=4)` interior than Codebook 9's zero-heavy
  distribution. The §4.6.3.3 sign-bit suffix applies after every
  non-zero coefficient (one suffix bit per non-zero, low-frequency
  first via `apply_sign_bits` / `derive_sign_bits`) and lies outside
  the Huffman codeword carried by this module. Public constants
  `HCOD10_NUM_ENTRIES = 169`, `HCOD10_MAX_LEN = 12`. Public functions
  `hcod10_encode(idx) -> (length, codeword)` (right-aligned in
  `u16`), `hcod10_decode(reader) -> idx` (MSB-first prefix match,
  linear scan against the 169-row table), and the convenience writer
  `hcod10_write(writer, idx)`. Out-of-range indices (`idx > 168`)
  surface as `Error::SpectralCodebookIndexOutOfRange(10)`; the
  decoder surfaces `Error::UnexpectedEnd` on reader underflow. The
  table is a **complete** prefix code (Kraft equality `Σ 2^(12 − L)
  = 4096 = 2^12`), exhaustively verified by walking every 12-bit
  prefix at unit-test time and asserting each maps to exactly one
  entry — so the decoder's `unreachable!()` fall-through is dead by
  construction. Adds 17 new unit tests and 22 new integration tests
  covering table shape, Kraft completeness, per-row PDF spot checks,
  the §4.6.3.3 wire-index ↔ tuple ↔ wire-index cross-check, the
  169-pair bijection sweep, per-index sign-bit-count invariants
  against `derive_sign_bits(10, …)`, hand-pinned byte sequences for
  indices 14 and 168, rejection paths, and the Codebooks 9 / 10
  shared-universe / pulled-down-ceiling / displaced-zero-tuple
  cross-checks.

  Annex 4.A Table 4.A.10 (Spectrum Huffman Codebook 9) wire layer.
  Codebook 9 is the first **expanded-LAV unsigned pair** spectrum
  book — Table 4.95 row 9 declares `unsigned_cb = 1`, `dim = 2`,
  `LAV = 12`, so the §4.6.3.3 universe shifts from Codebooks 7 / 8's
  shared `8 × 8 = 64`-entry `LAV = 7` lattice to a `(12 + 1)^2 =
  13^2 = 169`-entry lattice indexed `0..=168` with each `(y, z)`
  coefficient in `0..=12`. The §4.6.3.3 unsigned polynomial
  `idx = y * (LAV + 1) + z = y * 13 + z` parks the zero-tuple
  `(0, 0)` at index 0 with the 1-bit `0` codeword — matching the
  head-placement Codebook 7 uses — and pins the maximum tuple
  `(12, 12)` at index 168 with a 15-bit `0x7fff`. The maximum
  codeword length is **15 bits**, the widest non-ESC codeword in
  Annex 4.A — a 5-bit jump over Codebook 8's 10-bit ceiling
  reflecting the `169 / 64 ≈ 2.6×` universe expansion. Exactly four
  rows reach the 15-bit ceiling: indices 142 (`0x7ffc`), 154
  (`0x7ffd`), 155 (`0x7ffe`), and 168 (`0x7fff`) — the rarest pair
  magnitudes near the `LAV = 12` cap. The §4.6.3.3 sign-bit suffix
  applies after every non-zero coefficient (one suffix bit per
  non-zero, low-frequency first via `apply_sign_bits` /
  `derive_sign_bits`) and lies outside the Huffman codeword carried
  by this module. Public constants `HCOD9_NUM_ENTRIES = 169`,
  `HCOD9_MAX_LEN = 15`. Public functions `hcod9_encode(idx) ->

  -> idx` (MSB-first prefix match, linear scan against the 169-row
  table), and the convenience writer `hcod9_write(writer, idx)`.
  Out-of-range indices (`idx > 168`) surface as
  `Error::SpectralCodebookIndexOutOfRange(9)`; the decoder surfaces
  `Error::UnexpectedEnd` on reader underflow. The table is a
  **complete** prefix code (Kraft equality `Σ 2^(15 − L) = 32768 =
  2^15`), exhaustively verified by walking every 15-bit prefix at
  unit-test time and asserting each maps to exactly one entry — so
  the decoder's `unreachable!()` fall-through is dead by
  construction. Adds 16 new unit tests and 25 new integration tests
  covering table shape, Kraft completeness, per-row PDF spot checks,
  the §4.6.3.3 wire-index ↔ tuple ↔ wire-index cross-check, the
  169-pair bijection sweep, per-index sign-bit-count invariants
  against `derive_sign_bits(9, …)`, hand-pinned byte sequences for
  indices 0 and 168, rejection paths, and the Codebooks 7 / 8 / 9
  expanded-LAV / head-placement / ceiling-delta cross-checks.
  Lands one of the three remaining `Codebooks 9..=11` line items
  in the §4.6.3 spectrum-data trail and adds the largest non-ESC
  spectrum book in the entire Annex 4.A book set.

  Codebook 8 is the second **unsigned pair** spectrum book and
  shares Codebook 7's Table 4.95 row shape (row 8: `unsigned_cb =
  1`, `dim = 2`, `LAV = 7` → `(7 + 1)^2 = 8^2 = 64` entries indexed
  `0..=63`, each tuple coefficient in `0..=7`) but uses a different
  per-row Huffman length tuning. Where Codebook 7 puts the zero-tuple
  `(0, 0)` at index 0 with a 1-bit `0` codeword and lets the
  upper-right quadrant of the lattice climb to a 12-bit ceiling,
  Codebook 8 lifts the zero-tuple at index 0 to a 5-bit `0xe` and
  migrates the shortest codeword (3 bits `0b000`) to the interior
  tuple `(y, z) = (1, 1)` at **index 9**. The maximum codeword
  length is **10 bits** (vs 12 for Codebook 7); exactly four rows
  reach the ceiling: indices 7 (`0x3fe`), 47 (`0x3fc`), 56
  (`0x3fd`), and 63 (`0x3ff`) — the rarest pair magnitudes. The
  §4.6.3.3 sign-bit suffix applies after every non-zero coefficient

  64` entries indexed `0..=63`, each tuple coefficient in `0..=7`).
  The §4.6.3.3 polynomial `idx = y * (LAV + 1) + z = y * 8 + z` parks
  the zero-tuple `(0, 0)` at index 0 (the origin of the unsigned
  dim-2 lattice) and the far corner `(7, 7)` at index 63. The
  shortest codeword is a single bit `0` at index 0 — the same head
  placement Codebook 3 uses for its unsigned dim-4 universe. The
  maximum codeword length is **12 bits**; exactly four rows reach

  `dim = 2`, `LAV = 4` → `(2 * 4 + 1)^2 = 9^2 = 81` entries indexed
  `0..=80`, each tuple coefficient in `-4..=+4`) but uses a different
  per-row Huffman length tuning. Where Codebook 5 puts the zero-tuple
  `(0, 0)` at index 40 with a 1-bit `0` codeword and lets the four
  lattice corners stretch out to a 13-bit ceiling, Codebook 6 lifts
  the zero-tuple to a 4-bit `0b0000` and tightens the maximum
  codeword length back to **11 bits**. Exactly four rows occupy that
  ceiling: indices 0 (`0x7fe`), 8 (`0x7fd`), 72 (`0x7ff`), and
  80 (`0x7fc`) — the same four `(±4, ±4)` lattice corners Codebook 5
  also pinned to its ceiling. No sign-bit suffix follows the

  Annex 4.A Table 4.A.6 (Spectrum Huffman Codebook 5) wire layer.
  Codebook 5 is the first **pair** spectrum book (Table 4.95 row 5:
  `unsigned_cb = 0`, `dim = 2`, `LAV = 4` → `(2 * 4 + 1)^2 = 9^2 = 81`
  entries indexed `0..=80`, each tuple coefficient in `-4..=+4`). The
  zero-tuple `(0, 0)` lands at index 40 — the centre row — because
  the §4.6.3.3 polynomial `idx = (y + LAV) * 9 + (z + LAV)` puts the
  origin at the centre of the index range for signed pair books; the
  shortest codeword (1 bit `0`) parks there too. The maximum
  codeword length is **13 bits** and exactly four rows occupy the
  ceiling: indices 0 (`0x1fff`), 8 (`0x1ffd`), 72 (`0x1ffc`), and
  80 (`0x1ffe`) — the four `(±4, ±4)` corners of the signed `9 × 9`
  pair lattice. No sign-bit suffix follows the codeword on the wire
  (Codebook 5 is signed: the index alone fully specifies each
  signed pair via the `offset = 4` shift). Public constants
  `HCOD5_NUM_ENTRIES = 81`, `HCOD5_MAX_LEN = 13`. Public functions
  `hcod5_encode(idx) -> (length, codeword)` (right-aligned in `u16`),
  `hcod5_decode(reader) -> idx` (MSB-first prefix match, linear scan
  against the 81-row table), and the convenience writer
  `hcod5_write(writer, idx)`. Out-of-range indices (`idx > 80`)
  surface as `Error::SpectralCodebookIndexOutOfRange(5)`; the
  decoder surfaces `Error::UnexpectedEnd` on reader underflow. The
  table is a **complete** prefix code (Kraft equality
  `Σ 2^(13 − L) = 8192 = 2^13`), exhaustively verified by walking
  every 13-bit prefix at unit-test time and asserting each maps to
  exactly one entry — so the decoder's `unreachable!()` fall-through
  is verifiably dead. Encode-then-decode round-trips every index for
  both the direct API and the cross-check against the round-213
  `spectral_codebook::decode_index_to_tuple` /
  `encode_tuple_to_index` §4.6.3.3 translation across the entire
  signed pair lattice. A `derive_sign_bits(5, &tuple)` cross-check
  confirms every Codebook 5 index emits zero sign bits on the wire,
  matching the signed-book contract. 16 new unit tests in

  Codebook 4 shares Codebook 3's unsigned dim-4 LAV-2 tuple universe
  (Table 4.95 row 4 = row 3 except for the source-table column:
  `unsigned_cb = 1`, `dim = 4`, `LAV = 2` → `3^4 = 81` entries indexed
  `0..=80`, each tuple coefficient in `0..=2`, with the §4.6.3.3
  sign-bit suffix carrying the sign of every non-zero coefficient
  outside the Huffman codeword) but uses a different per-row Huffman
  length tuning: maximum codeword length is **12 bits** (vs 16 for
  Codebook 3); the **shortest** codeword (4 bits `0b0000`) sits at
  **index 40** while index 0 (still the §4.6.3.3 zero-tuple
  `(0, 0, 0, 0)`) carries a 4-bit `0b0111`; the two 12-bit rows are
  index 62 (`0xfff`) and index 74 (`0xffe`). Public constants
  `HCOD4_NUM_ENTRIES = 81`, `HCOD4_MAX_LEN = 12`. Public functions
  `hcod4_encode(idx) -> (length, codeword)` (right-aligned in `u16`),

  `hcod4_write(writer, idx)`. Out-of-range indices (`idx > 80`)
  surface as `Error::SpectralCodebookIndexOutOfRange(4)`; the
  decoder surfaces `Error::UnexpectedEnd` on reader underflow. The
  table is a **complete** prefix code (Kraft equality
  `Σ 2^(12 − L) = 4096 = 2^12`), exhaustively verified by walking
  every 12-bit prefix at unit-test time and asserting each maps to

  both the direct API and the cross-check against the round-213
  `spectral_codebook::decode_index_to_tuple` /
  `encode_tuple_to_index` §4.6.3.3 translation. A Codebook 3 /
  Codebook 4 cross-check confirms the two books map every index to
  the *same* magnitude tuple — only the codeword assignment differs,
  since the §4.6.3.3 translation depends on the Table 4.95 row shape
  (identical for rows 3 and 4) and not on the codeword bit pattern.

  Codebooks 5..=11 (Tables 4.A.6 … 4.A.12) reuse the same encode /

  are the first **pair** (`dim = 2`) books with `LAV = 4`, opening a

  Codebook 3 is the first *unsigned* spectrum book (Table 4.95 row 3:
  `unsigned_cb = 1`, `dim = 4`, `LAV = 2`); the index space is still
  `3^4 = 81` (the `(LAV + 1)^dim` polynomial for unsigned books
  coincides with the `(2*LAV + 1)^dim` of the `LAV = 1` signed books)
  but the tuple universe is now `0..=2` per coefficient instead of
  `-1..=+1`, and the §4.6.3.3 sign-bit suffix carries the sign of
  each non-zero coefficient outside the Huffman codeword. Maximum
  codeword length is **16 bits** (vs 11 for Codebook 1 and 9 for
  Codebook 2). The zero magnitude tuple `(0, 0, 0, 0)` lives at
  **index 0** (not 40 as in the signed books) because the unsigned
  polynomial puts all-zero at the origin; it carries the single-bit
  codeword `0`. Two distinct rows carry the full 16-bit codewords:
  index 62 (`0xffff`) and index 74 (`0xfffe`). Public constants
  `HCOD3_NUM_ENTRIES = 81`, `HCOD3_MAX_LEN = 16`. Public functions
  `hcod3_encode(idx) -> (length, codeword)` (right-aligned in `u16`),

  `hcod3_write(writer, idx)`. Out-of-range indices (`idx > 80`)
  surface as `Error::SpectralCodebookIndexOutOfRange(3)`; the
  decoder surfaces `Error::UnexpectedEnd` on reader underflow. The
  table is a **complete** prefix code (Kraft equality
  `Σ 2^(16 − L) = 65536 = 2^16`), exhaustively verified by walking
  every 16-bit prefix at unit-test time and asserting each maps to

  `encode_tuple_to_index` §4.6.3.3 translation. The §4.6.3.3
  sign-bit suffix (`derive_sign_bits`) is exercised as a cross-check:
  every Codebook 3 index emits exactly as many sign bits as it has
  non-zero coefficients (the zero-tuple emits zero sign bits, the
  all-twos tuple emits four). 17 new unit tests in

  `unsigned_cb = 0`, `dim = 4`, `LAV = 1` → `3^4 = 81` entries indexed
  `0..=80`) but uses a different per-row Huffman length tuning:
  maximum codeword length is 9 bits (vs 11 for Codebook 1); index 40
  (the zero-tuple) carries the 3-bit codeword `0b000` (vs the

  Annex 4.A Table 4.A.2 (Spectrum Huffman Codebook 1) wire layer.
  Codebook 1 is the signed 4-tuple book (`unsigned_cb = 0`, `dim = 4`,
  `LAV = 1`) so the table enumerates every 4-tuple of coefficients in
  `(-1, 0, +1)^4` → `3^4 = 81` entries with codeword lengths
  `1..=11` bits. Index 40 — the zero-tuple `(0, 0, 0, 0)` — carries
  the single-bit codeword `0`. Public constants
  `HCOD1_NUM_ENTRIES = 81`, `HCOD1_MAX_LEN = 11`. Public functions
  `hcod1_encode(idx) -> (length, codeword)` (right-aligned in
  `u16`), `hcod1_decode(reader) -> idx` (MSB-first prefix match,
  linear scan against the 81-row table), and the convenience writer
  `hcod1_write(writer, idx)`. Out-of-range indices
  (`idx > 80`) surface as `Error::SpectralCodebookIndexOutOfRange(1)`;
  the decoder surfaces `Error::UnexpectedEnd` on reader underflow.
  The table is a **complete** prefix code (Kraft equality
  `Σ 2^(11 − L) = 2048 = 2^11`), exhaustively verified by walking
  every 11-bit prefix at unit-test time and asserting each maps to
  exactly one entry — so the decoder's `unreachable!()` fall-through

  `decode_index_to_tuple(codebook, idx)` returns the
  `dim`-tuple of quantised spectral coefficients (the spec's
  pseudocode for `dim == 4`: `w = INT(idx/mod^3) - off`, etc.; for
  `dim == 2`: `y, z`). Inverse: `encode_tuple_to_index(codebook,
  tuple)`. Sign-bit handling: `apply_sign_bits(codebook, tuple,
  signs)` folds the per-non-zero-coefficient sign bits from the
  wire onto an unsigned-codebook tuple; `derive_sign_bits(codebook,
  tuple)` extracts them in low-frequency-first order. ESC sequence:
  `decode_esc_value(prefix_len, escape_word)` returns
  `2^(prefix_len + 4) + escape_word`; `encode_esc_value(value)`
  inverts it. Public constant `MAX_QUANT = 8191` (§4.6.1.3
  maximum absolute amplitude for `x_quant`). All accessors reject
  non-spectral codebooks (`0`, `12..=15`) with

  hand off the trailing spectrum block to a future
  `spectral_data()` parser (or to a frame-assembler's
  `push_channel_body_bits`). Public constants

  (gain_control_data is AOT-3-only) reject with
  `Error::PulseDataEncodeInvalid` /
  `Error::GainControlDataEncodeInvalid`; the parser surfaces
  literal bits to keep hostile streams from panicking.
  `scale_flag == true` (scalable AAC, AOT 6) rejects with
  `Error::NotImplemented` on both sides. 15 new integration tests
  cover the minimal AAC-LC long body, the one-active-band variant,

  the all-tools-dispatched SSR stress, the
  `EIGHT_SHORT_SEQUENCE` pulse-data rejection, the populated-slot-
  without-dispatch-bit rejection, the AOT-3-only gain_control
  rejection, the CPE-shared-ics_info round-trip, the missing-
  inline-ics_info writer rejection, the `scale_flag == true`
  rejection on both sides, and the
  `spectral_data_bit_offset == bits_written` invariant. Suite
  grows 488 → 503 tests.
- phase 2 (r200): `tns_max` module — ISO/IEC 14496-3 §4.6.9.4 /
  Tables 4.102 (`TNS_MAX_ORDER`) and 4.103 (`TNS_MAX_BANDS`)
  decoder-side clamp tables, plus the §4.6.17.2.5 Tables 4.119 /
  4.120 LD-specific `TNS_MAX_BANDS` tables for the 480- and
  512-sample AAC LD frame variants. Exposed as the accessors
  `tns_max_order(aot, window_sequence, fs_index)`,
  `tns_max_bands(aot, window_sequence, fs_index)`,
  `tns_max_bands_ld_480(fs_index)`,
  `tns_max_bands_ld_512(fs_index)`, plus the three-way
  `min(band, TNS_MAX_BANDS, max_sfb)` and
  `min(order, TNS_MAX_ORDER)` clamp helpers `clamp_tns_band` and
  `clamp_tns_order` that fold the §4.6.9.3 pseudocode into one
  call. Public AOT constants `AOT_AAC_MAIN`, `AOT_AAC_LC`,
  `AOT_AAC_SSR`, `AOT_AAC_LTP`, `AOT_ER_AAC_LD` and the per-rate
  LD tables `TNS_MAX_BANDS_LD_480: [Option<u8>; 12]` /
  `TNS_MAX_BANDS_LD_512: [Option<u8>; 12]`. Table 4.102 dispatch
  partitions the long-window column at the > 32 kHz / ≤ 32 kHz
  threshold; Table 4.103 dispatch routes AOT 3 (AAC SSR) through
  the PQF-filterbank columns and every other AOT through the
  non-PQF columns. Out-of-range `fs_index` (`>= 13`) and the
  uncovered LD rates surface as
  `Error::IcsInfoUnsupportedSampleRateIndex`. 34 new tests
  (24 unit + 10 integration). Suite grows 454 → 488 tests.
- phase 2 (r194): `swb_offset` module — ISO/IEC 14496-3 §4.5.4.1 /
  Tables 4.129–4.141 `swb_offset_long_window[]` and
  `swb_offset_short_window[]` lookup tables for all 12 standard
  `samplingFrequencyIndex` values. Exposed as
  `SWB_OFFSET_LONG_WINDOW[13]` and `SWB_OFFSET_SHORT_WINDOW[13]`
  const slices (slot `12` empty — 7350 Hz has no defined SWB
  table); safe accessors `long_window_offsets(fs_index)` and
  `short_window_offsets(fs_index)`. Adds `LONG_WINDOW_LEN` /
  `SHORT_WINDOW_LEN` spectrum-length constants (1024 / 128).
- phase 2 (r194): `swb_offset::apply_pulse_data` — §4.6.13
  pulse-escape reconstruction loop, the crate's first
  spectrum-reconstruction-layer entry point. Consumes a parsed
  `pulse_data::PulseData` block plus a `&mut [i32]` long-window
  `x_quant` slice, folds the per-pulse `±pulse_amp` fix-up at the
  running coefficient index
  `k = swb_offset_long[fs][pulse_start_sfb] + Σ pulse_offset[i]`.
  Rejects malformed bitstreams (`pulse_start_sfb` past the last
  real band, `k` overrun past `LONG_WINDOW_LEN`, empty / >4 pulse
  list) via `Error::PulseDataEncodeInvalid`, unsupported
  `fs_index` via `Error::IcsInfoUnsupportedSampleRateIndex`. Suite
  size grows 409 → 454 tests (+45: 33 unit + 12 integration).

### Added (round 192 — Table 1.15 trailing syncExtensionType == 0x2b7 implicit-SBR probe)

- New `AudioSpecificConfig` field `trailing_sbr_probe:
  Option<SbrExtensionProbe>` carrying the result of the §1.6.5 /
  Table 1.15 trailing-bits backward-compatible implicit-SBR /
  PS / ER BSAC-extension probe.
- New entry point `AudioSpecificConfig::parse_bits_bounded(reader,
  origin_bit_offset, asc_bit_length)` for carriers that know the
  ASC bit length (LATM `StreamMuxConfig`, esds AudioObj
  descriptor). The existing `AudioSpecificConfig::parse(&[u8])`
  now computes the byte-slice bound and calls into the new entry
  point automatically; `AudioSpecificConfig::parse_bits` keeps
  its no-probe semantics so callers holding a `BitReader`
  carrying trailing carrier bytes are not surprised by a stray
  11-bit `0x2b7` match.
- Probe field-width / marker constants exposed as public
  module-level constants: `SYNC_EXTENSION_TYPE_BITS = 11`,
  `SYNC_EXTENSION_TYPE_SBR = 0x2b7`, `SYNC_EXTENSION_TYPE_PS =
  0x548`, `TRAILING_EXTENSION_AOT_SBR = 5`,
  `TRAILING_EXTENSION_AOT_BSAC = 22`.
- Probe semantics — driven by the spec's two guards:
  - Outer guard: `extensionAudioObjectType != 5` (skip when the
    outer `audioObjectType` is the explicit hierarchical SBR
    (5) or PS (29) wrapper, which already established
    `extensionAudioObjectType == 5`) **and** `bits_to_decode()
    >= 16` (the ASC carrier must have at least 11 + 5 bits
    remaining to attempt the 11-bit `syncExtensionType` plus a
    minimum-width nested `GetAudioObjectType()`).
  - On a `0x2b7` match the parser dispatches on the resolved
    extension AOT:
    - `5` → `sbrPresentFlag` + (when set) the 4-bit
      `extensionSamplingFrequencyIndex` (with the 24-bit
      `extensionSamplingFrequency` escape on the `0xf`
      sentinel) + (when at least 12 further bits remain) a
      second 11-bit `syncExtensionType == 0x548` gating a
      1-bit `psPresentFlag`.
    - `22` → `sbrPresentFlag` + (when set) the 4-bit
      `extensionSamplingFrequencyIndex` (with the same 24-bit
      escape) + mandatory 4-bit
      `extensionChannelConfiguration`.
    - any other value → `Error::UnsupportedTrailingExtensionAot`
      (Table 1.15 spells out no body layout for those).
- Propagation: when the probe records `sbr_present_flag == true`
  the resolved extension sample rate is also promoted to
  `AudioSpecificConfig::extension_sampling_frequency_index` /
  `AudioSpecificConfig::extension_sample_rate` and
  `AudioSpecificConfig::sbr_present` is set; when the probe
  records `ps_present_flag == Some(true)`
  `AudioSpecificConfig::ps_present` is set; when the probe
  resolves the BSAC branch the
  `AudioSpecificConfig::extension_channel_configuration` field
  is set. This mirrors the explicit-SBR / PS wrapper path so
  call sites can read SBR / PS state from a single top-level
  field set whether the signalling was hierarchical-explicit or
  trailing-implicit.
- New `Error::UnsupportedTrailingExtensionAot(u8)` variant for
  resolved extension AOTs whose Table 1.15 body is not defined
  (anything outside `{5, 22}`).
- 20 new integration tests in `tests/asc.rs` (`suite size 389 →
  409`) covering:
  - Field-width / marker constant pin.
  - Four "probe-skipped" branches: no trailing bits at all,
    fewer than 16 bits remaining (one byte of pad), 11-bit
    non-`0x2b7` value, outer SBR wrapper (AOT 5) and outer PS
    wrapper (AOT 29) guard skipping the probe even with
    trailing bits that *would* match.
  - SBR-branch round-trips: `sbrPresentFlag = 0`,
    `sbrPresentFlag = 1` with a Table 1.18 index, `sfi = 0xf`
    with the 24-bit escape, the PS sub-probe with
    `psPresentFlag = 1`, the PS marker mismatch (non-0x548
    inner sync — `ps_present_flag` stays `None`), and the
    inner 12-bit guard skipping the PS sub-probe with only 8
    bits of slack.
  - ER BSAC-branch round-trips: `sbrPresentFlag = 1` with a
    rate + `extensionChannelConfiguration = 2`,
    `sbrPresentFlag = 0` with `extensionChannelConfiguration = 3`.
  - `Error::UnsupportedTrailingExtensionAot(3)` reject for an
    `extensionAudioObjectType` outside `{5, 22}`.
  - `parse_bits` no-probe contract — the bit-level entry point
    stops at end-of-body and leaves trailing bits alone.
  - `parse_bits_bounded` explicit-`asc_bit_length` call shape —
    one round-trip plus a truncated-bound assertion that the
    probe does not over-read when the bound stops at the body.
  - Mid-escape truncation surfaces `Error::UnexpectedEnd` (24-bit
    explicit-rate escape cut to 16 bits).
  - Hand-pinned 7-byte HE-AAC v2 implicit chain (AOT 2 / 16 kHz
    / mono + 0x2b7 + ext_aot=5 + sbr=1 + sfi=5 + 0x548 + ps=1).

### Added (round 187 — extension_payload() parser + encoder primitive)

- New `extension_payload` module implementing the ISO/IEC 14496-3
  §4.4.2.7 / Table 4.51 `extension_payload()` body that rides inside
  every FIL element, plus the Table 4.52 `dynamic_range_info()` and
  Table 4.53 `excluded_channels()` sub-bodies:
  - `ExtensionType` enum with the five well-known values (`Fill`,
    `FillData`, `DynamicRange` per Table 4.59;`SbrData`,
    `SbrDataCrc` per ISO/IEC 13818-7 Table 40) and the
    `from_bits` / `as_u8` round-trip pair.
  - `ExtensionPayload::Fill { cnt, other_bits }` — Table 4.51
    default branch carrying `8 * (cnt - 1) + 4` `other_bits`
    packed MSB-first.
  - `ExtensionPayload::FillData { cnt }` — Table 4.51 normative
    pattern: 4-bit `fill_nibble == 0b0000` + (cnt - 1) × 8-bit
    `fill_byte == 0b1010_0101`.
  - `ExtensionPayload::DynamicRange(DynamicRangeInfo)` — Table 4.52
    DRC body carrier with optional `PceTagFields`, optional
    `ExcludedChannels` (Table 4.53), optional `DrcBands`
    partitioning, optional `ProgRefLevelFields`, and the per-band
    `(dyn_rng_sgn, dyn_rng_ctl)` `DrcBandRecord` list whose length
    matches the resolved `drc_num_bands`.
- `ExtensionPayload::parse(reader, cnt)` walks the Table 4.51
  dispatch (4-bit `extension_type`, then per-type body) and
  surfaces the SBR extension types as
  `Error::UnsupportedExtensionSbr` (since this crate does not
  carry the QMF / patching back-end), reserved values as
  `Error::UnsupportedExtensionType`, and structural / normative-
  value violations as `Error::ExtensionPayloadInvalid`.
- `ExtensionPayload::write(writer)` is the bit-exact inverse;
  returns Table 4.51's `n` byte count and surfaces caller-side
  field overflows / shape mismatches as
  `Error::ExtensionPayloadInvalid`.
- `ExtensionPayload::byte_length` / `DynamicRangeInfo::byte_length` /
  `DynamicRangeInfo::num_bands` accessors for callers that need the
  Table 4.51 returned `n` without round-tripping through `write`.
- Public helper `excluded_group_count(exclude_mask_len)` exposing
  Table 4.53's 7-bit-group → 8-bit-byte mapping.
- Public field-width constants: `EXTENSION_TYPE_BITS = 4`,
  `FILL_DATA_NIBBLE = 0b0000`, `FILL_DATA_BYTE = 0b1010_0101`.
- Three new `Error` variants: `UnsupportedExtensionSbr(u8)` for
  the SBR extension types, `UnsupportedExtensionType(u8)` for
  reserved 4-bit values, and `ExtensionPayloadInvalid` for
  caller-side wire-field violations and parser-side normative-
  value / structural mismatches.
- 36 integration tests in `tests/extension_payload.rs` covering
  Table 4.59 / Table 40 dispatch (known values, round-trip, SBR
  rejection, reserved rejection), the EXT_FILL `cnt == 1`
  collapsed body, an EXT_FILL `cnt == 3` round-trip with a
  partial trailing byte, the EXT_FILL_DATA cases with hand-
  pinned byte sequences and the two normative rejections (non-
  zero nibble, non-`0xA5` byte), the DRC minimal body (hand-
  pinned bytes `[0xB0, 0x42]`), single-optional round-trips for
  pce_tag / excluded_channels / drc_bands / prog_ref_level, an
  every-optional-present round-trip (`n == 9`), the
  continuation-bit positioning across a two-group exclude_mask
  (hand-pinned bytes `[0xB6, 0x04, 0x08, 0x00]`), six encoder-
  side overflow rejections, a parser-side `cnt`-vs-`n` mismatch
  detection, three truncation tests, an `excluded_group_count`
  lookup-table check, the `byte_length` / `num_bands` accessor
  checks, and a trailing-bit non-consumption assertion. Suite
  size grows 353 → 389.

### Added (round 183 — gain_control_data() parser + encoder primitive)

- New `gain_control_data` module implementing the ISO/IEC 14496-3
  §4.4.6.5 / Table 4.12 `gain_control_data()` syntax element used by
  the SSR (Scalable Sample Rate, AOT 3) gain-control tool:
  - `GainControlData { max_band: u8, bands: Vec<GainBand> }` —
    parsed Table 4.12 block, with `bands.len() == max_band` mapping
    the per-spec `bd ∈ 1..=max_band` band index onto `bands[bd - 1]`.
  - `GainBand { windows: Vec<GainWindow> }` — per-`bd` collection
    whose length matches the per-`window_sequence` window count
    (1 for `OnlyLong`, 2 for `LongStart` / `LongStop`, 8 for
    `EightShort`).
  - `GainWindow { adjustments: Vec<GainAdjust> }` — per-`(bd, wd)`
    ladder; `adjustments.len()` is the wire `adjust_num` value
    (`0..=7`).
  - `GainAdjust { alevcode: u8, aloccode: u8 }` — single ladder
    entry with the 4-bit `alevcode` and the per-slot-width
    `aloccode`.
- `GainControlData::parse(reader, window_sequence)` walks the
  Table 4.12 syntax: 2-bit `max_band`, then for each `bd` in
  `1..=max_band` and each `wd` in `0..N(window_sequence)` a 3-bit
  `adjust_num` followed by `adjust_num` `(4-bit alevcode,
  W(seq, wd)-bit aloccode)` records.
- `GainControlData::write(writer, window_sequence)` is the bit-exact
  inverse; caller-side field violations surface as
  `Error::GainControlDataEncodeInvalid`.
- Public helpers `num_windows(window_sequence)` and
  `aloccode_bits(window_sequence, wd)` pin Table 4.12's per-`seq`
  loop count and the per-`(seq, wd)` `aloccode` width (5 / 4-2 /
  2-2 / 4-5 across `OnlyLong` / `LongStart` / `EightShort` /
  `LongStop`).
- Public field-width constants `MAX_BAND_BITS = 2`,
  `ADJUST_NUM_BITS = 3`, `ALEVCODE_BITS = 4` and the cap constants
  `MAX_BAND_CAP = 0x03`, `MAX_ADJUST_NUM = 0x07`,
  `MAX_ALEVCODE = 0x0f`.
- New `Error::GainControlDataEncodeInvalid` variant for caller-side
  field-overflow / shape-mismatch on the encoder.
- 20 integration tests in `tests/gain_control_data.rs` covering the
  per-`window_sequence` `num_windows` and `aloccode_bits` lookup
  tables, the `max_band == 0` collapsed body byte layout, a hand-
  pinned `OnlyLong` wire-bit assertion, self-roundtrip across the
  four window sequences (including a max-everything `EightShort`
  with `max_band = 3` and every per-slot adjustment maxed out), six
  encoder-side overflow rejections (max-band, band-count mismatch,
  window-count mismatch, adjust-num overflow, alevcode overflow,
  aloccode overflow at the 5-bit / 2-bit slots), an
  `UnexpectedEnd` mid-record truncation test, and a trailing-bit
  non-consumption check confirming the parser does not over-read
  past the Table 4.12 body. Suite size grows 333 → 353.

### Added (round 177 — GASpecificConfig extensionFlag body + ER-AOT epConfig)

- `asc::GaSpecificConfig::extension_body: Option<GaExtensionBody>` —
  parsed body of the `if (extensionFlag)` branch of `GASpecificConfig`
  per ISO/IEC 14496-3 §4.4.1 / Table 4.1. Populated when the
  `extensionFlag` bit (which precedes the layerNr in Table 4.1) was
  `1` on the wire.
- `asc::GaExtensionBody { bsac_layer, resilience, extension_flag3 }`
  carrier struct:
  - `bsac_layer: Option<BsacLayerSpec { num_of_sub_frame: u8 (5 bit),
    layer_length: u16 (11 bit) }>` — emitted only when the
    surrounding `audioObjectType == 22` (ER BSAC).
  - `resilience: Option<AacResilienceFlags { section_data,
    scalefactor_data, spectral_data }>` — emitted only when the
    surrounding `audioObjectType ∈ {17, 19, 20, 23}` (ER AAC LC /
    ER AAC LTP / ER AAC scalable / ER AAC LD). Stores the three
    `aac*ResilienceFlag` bits used by the §4.4.6 RVLC scalefactor
    branch + the §4.4.6 HCR spectral branch in downstream rounds.
  - `extension_flag3: bool` — always present at the tail of the
    extension body. ISO/IEC 14496-3:2009 reserves the body behind
    this flag with the comment "tbd in version 3"; Phase 1
    surfaces the bit but rejects the body itself with the new
    `Error::UnsupportedAscExtensionFlag3` when the flag is `1`.
- `asc::AudioSpecificConfig::ep_config: Option<u8>` — Table 1.15
  trailing 2-bit `epConfig` field emitted for AOTs ∈
  {17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 39}. Phase 1 supports
  `epConfig ∈ {0, 1}` (no inline `ErrorProtectionSpecificConfig()`
  body); `epConfig == 2 || 3` (which mandate `EPSpecificConfig()`
  parsing) surface as the new `Error::UnsupportedEpConfig(u8)`.
- New `Error::UnsupportedEpConfig(u8)` variant carrying the literal
  2-bit `epConfig` value as read from the wire.
- New `Error::UnsupportedAscExtensionFlag3` variant.
- 13 new integration tests in `tests/asc.rs` covering: AAC-LC
  regression (extension body / ep_config both `None`); ER AAC LC
  with the full resilience triplet + epConfig 0; ER AAC LC with
  epConfig 1 accepted; ER AAC LC rejection at epConfig 2 and 3;
  ER BSAC (AOT 22) `numOfSubFrame` + `layer_length` pair with an
  inline PCE; ER AAC LD (AOT 23) resilience triplet only; ER AAC
  scalable (AOT 20) covering BOTH the layerNr branch AND the
  resilience triplet in the correct Table 4.1 order; ER TwinVQ
  (AOT 21) where the extension body collapses to `extensionFlag3`
  + `epConfig` only; `extensionFlag3 == 1` rejection; truncation
  inside the resilience body and at the `epConfig` field; and a
  hand-pinned bit-position assertion (a 22-bit ER AAC LC ASC).
  Suite size grows 320 → 333 tests.
- Module-level documentation in `src/asc.rs` rewritten to reflect
  the new coverage and to remove the round-126 "What is not parsed
  yet" entries that this round closes (`epConfig` and the
  `extensionFlag` body); the `syncExtensionType == 0x2b7` implicit-
  SBR probe and the FIL-extension-payload implicit path remain
  listed as deferred.

### Added (round 165 — `Pce::write` + `FrameAssembler::push_pce`)

- `pce::Pce::write(writer, origin_bit_offset)` — encoder primitive for
  the `program_config_element()` per ISO/IEC 14496-3 §4.4.1.1 /
  Table 4.2, the bit-exact inverse of the round-126 `Pce::parse`. Emits
  the full PCE wire layout: 4-bit `element_instance_tag` + 2-bit
  `object_type` + 4-bit `sampling_frequency_index`; element counts
  (4-bit `num_front`, 4-bit `num_side`, 4-bit `num_back`, 2-bit
  `num_lfe`, 3-bit `num_assoc`, 4-bit `num_valid_cc`); mix-down
  presence flags + bodies (`mono_mixdown_present` + 4-bit
  `mono_mixdown_element_number`; `stereo_mixdown_present` + 4-bit
  `stereo_mixdown_element_number`; `matrix_mixdown_idx_present` +
  2-bit `matrix_mixdown_idx` + 1-bit `pseudo_surround_enable`); the
  per-element select lists (`front` / `side` / `back` are
  `(1-bit is_cpe, 4-bit tag_select)` pairs; `lfe` and `assoc` are
  bare 4-bit `tag_select` values; `valid_cc` is
  `(1-bit is_ind_sw, 4-bit tag_select)` pairs); a §4.4.1.1 Note 1
  origin-relative `byte_alignment()`; then the 8-bit
  `comment_field_bytes` length prefix + `comment_field` bytes. The
  origin handling mirrors the parser exactly — pass `0` for a
  standalone PCE inside a `raw_data_block()` (collapses to absolute
  alignment), or the ASC origin bit-position for a PCE inline in
  `AudioSpecificConfig` (the ASC-relative form). Self-roundtrip
  (`write` → `parse`) is bit-perfect across the empty layout, a 5.1
  layout with mixed SCE / CPE / LFE / CC and a comment field, every
  mix-down body permutation, the maximum-fields ladder (`tag=0x0f`,
  `object_type=3`, `sfi=0x0f`, 255-byte comment), and a non-zero-
  origin ASC-relative roundtrip.
- `raw_data_block::FrameAssembler::push_pce(&Pce)` — emits the 3-bit
  PCE `id_syn_ele` (`0b101`) followed by the full PCE body via
  `Pce::write` with `origin_bit_offset = 0`. Pairs with the round-121
  walker's `Element::ProgramConfig` branch; round-trips through the
  walker bit-exactly when placed before END, after a channel header,
  next to a FIL element, or with every mix-down + CC slot populated.
  Propagates `Error::PceEncodeInvalid` from `Pce::write` when any
  wire field overflows its bit-width. The round-160 `push_channel_header`
  still rejects `IdSynEle::Pce` — PCE has its own bespoke wire shape
  (with the §4.4.1.1 Note 1 origin alignment) and routes through this
  dedicated entry point instead.
- New `Error::PceEncodeInvalid` variant — surfaces caller-side
  structural bugs that cannot be represented on the Table 4.2 wire
  (any of the field-width caps listed in the variant's doc-comment).
- 26 new integration tests (`tests/pce.rs` +17,
  `tests/raw_data_block_encode.rs` +9) — self-roundtrip + every
  encoder-rejection branch + a non-zero-origin parser / writer
  agreement test + a hand-pinned wire-layout assertion that the
  all-zero PCE produces 6 all-zero bytes (header + counts + flags +
  6-bit pad + comment length). Crate suite size grows 294 → 320.

### Added (round 160 — §4.4.2.1 raw_data_block frame assembler)

- `raw_data_block::FrameAssembler` — encoder-side composition primitive
  for `raw_data_block()` per ISO/IEC 14496-3 §4.4.2.1, the bit-exact
  inverse of the round-121 `raw_data_block::Walker`. Wraps an internal
  [`oxideav_core::bits::BitWriter`] and exposes a small typed push-API:
  - `push_channel_header(kind, element_instance_tag)` emits the 3-bit
    `id_syn_ele` (`SCE` / `CPE` / `CCE` / `LFE`) + 4-bit
    `element_instance_tag`. The channel-element *body* (`ics_info` →
    `section_data` → `scale_factor_data` → optional `pulse_data` /
    `tns_data` → `spectral_data`) is the caller's responsibility — it
    is appended via the next entry point.
  - `push_channel_body_bits(bits, bit_count)` appends a pre-serialised
    channel-element body as an MSB-first packed bit-slice. This lets
    callers run the existing typed writers (`IcsInfo::write`,
    `SectionData::write`, `ScaleFactorData::write`, `PulseData::write`,
    `TnsData::write`) into an auxiliary [`BitWriter`] and splice the
    resulting bits into the frame without forcing the assembler to own
    every per-tool body layout.
  - `push_fill(payload)` emits a FIL element per §4.4.2.7 — 3-bit id +
    4-bit `count` + optional 8-bit `esc_count` (when `payload.len() >=
    15`) + payload bytes. The escape arithmetic inverts the parser's
    `cnt = esc_count + 15 - 1` to `esc_count = payload_bytes - 14`,
    capping single-element fill at 269 bytes.
  - `push_data(tag, byte_align_flag, payload)` emits a DSE element per
    §4.4.2.5 — 3-bit id + 4-bit `element_instance_tag` + 1-bit
    `data_byte_align_flag` + 8-bit `count` + optional 8-bit `esc_count`
    (when `payload.len() >= 255`) + optional byte-align (before payload
    bytes) + payload bytes. The escape arithmetic inverts the parser's
    `cnt = count + esc_count` to `esc_count = payload_bytes - 255`,
    capping single-element data at 510 bytes.
  - `push_end()` consumes the assembler, emits the 3-bit `END` (`0b111`)
    terminator, byte-aligns the writer per §4.4.2.1, and returns the
    finished `Vec<u8>`. END is mandatory (the type-state forces every
    completed frame to call it) and post-END pushes are a compile-time
    error.
- `Error::RawDataBlockEncodeInvalid` for caller-side structural bugs
  the assembler cannot represent on the wire: non-channel `IdSynEle`
  passed to `push_channel_header` (FIL / DSE / END have their own
  bespoke entry points; PCE has no writer yet); `element_instance_tag
  > 0x0f` on a channel or DSE element; FIL `payload.len() > 269`; DSE
  `payload.len() > 510`; or `push_channel_body_bits` called with
  `bit_count > bits.len() * 8`. Long fill / data payloads above the
  per-element ceilings split naturally across multiple back-to-back
  FIL / DSE elements with the same `tag`; the assembler intentionally
  enforces the single-element ceiling rather than splitting silently.
- PCE encoding is **not** in this round — the [`crate::pce::Pce`]
  struct is fully parsed (round 126) but has no `write` primitive yet,
  and adding one is a separate round's worth of work (Tables 4.4 / 4.5
  front/side/back/lfe element selects, mono / stereo / matrix mix-down
  hints, comment field, plus the relative-origin `byte_alignment()`
  per Table 4.2 Note 1). The assembler rejects PCE in
  `push_channel_header` rather than admitting an `Element::ProgramConfig`
  variant the writer cannot honour.
- 30 new integration tests in `tests/raw_data_block_encode.rs`:
  END-only frame (one-byte `0xE0` wire-layout pin); channel-header
  push for every `(SCE, CPE, CCE, LFE)` × `(tag = 0, 7, 0x0a, 0x0f)`
  combination with a hand-pinned wire-byte assertion for the
  SCE(tag=0x0a)+END case (`[0x15, 0xC0]`); rejection of non-channel
  kinds (`Dse`, `Pce`, `Fil`, `End`) and over-4-bit tags; channel-body
  bit-append for partial-byte (12-bit), whole-byte (32-bit), and
  zero-count cases with a hand-pinned three-byte wire-layout assertion
  (`[0x01, 0x57, 0x9C]` for SCE(tag=0)+0xABC(12-bit)+END); FIL empty
  pin (`[0xC1, 0xC0]`), every `payload_bytes ∈ 0..15`, escape-boundary
  pair (15 / 16), max-payload-269 roundtrip, and rejection above 269;
  DSE short / byte-align-set / byte-align-with-mid-byte-offset /
  escape-boundary-255 / max-510 roundtrips and rejection above 510 /
  over-4-bit tag; composite frames (SCE+FIL+END mirroring the parser
  test, CPE+13-bit-body+DSE+FIL+END, two back-to-back FIL elements);
  `bit_position` tracking; and END byte-alignment after an unaligned
  body. Suite size grows 264 → 294 tests.

### Added (round 152 — §4.6.2.3.2 / §4.6.8.1.4 / §4.6.13 DPCM accumulator pair)

- `scale_factor_data::accumulate(sfd, sfb_cb, global_gain) ->
  Result<AbsoluteScaleFactors>` — the symmetric decoder-side
  accumulator that converts the transmitted DPCM record set
  produced by `ScaleFactorData::parse` into absolute per-band
  quantities. Runs three independent DPCM tracks: spectrum
  scalefactors (seed `last_sf = global_gain`, range `0..=255` per
  the §4.6.2.3.2 Note), intensity stereo positions (seed
  `last_is = 0` per §4.6.8.1.4), and PNS noise energies (seed
  `last_nrg = global_gain - NOISE_OFFSET - 256` per §4.6.13, with
  the first PNS band of the frame's 9-bit `uimsbf` literal added
  directly and every subsequent PNS band's Huffman delta in
  `-60..=+60`). Returns `Error::ScaleFactorAccumulatorInvalid` on
  shape mismatch with `sfb_cb`, variant ↔ codebook mismatch, second
  `NoisePcm` after the frame-scope flag cleared, or `Sf`-track
  running value escaping `0..=255`.
- `scale_factor_data::differentiate(abs, sfb_cb, global_gain) ->
  Result<ScaleFactorData>` — the symmetric encoder-side inverse.
  Takes absolute per-band records (the output of rate-allocation
  / scalefactor quantisation / PNS noise-energy estimation) and
  produces the DPCM record set the bit-exact `ScaleFactorData::write`
  consumes. Validates every spectrum / intensity / PNS-subsequent
  delta against Table 4.150's `-60..=+60`, the first PNS band's
  initial seed magnitude against the 9-bit `uimsbf` Table 4.53
  field (`0..=511`), variant ↔ codebook agreement, and outer / inner
  shape against `sfb_cb`. Roundtrip: `accumulate(differentiate(abs,
  sfb_cb, gg)?, sfb_cb, gg)? == abs` on every well-formed input.
- `scale_factor_data::AbsoluteScaleFactorEntry { Sf(u8) /
  IsPos(i16) / NoiseNrg(i32) }` — the per-band absolute record
  variant. `Sf` for spectrum-band scalefactors (`0..=255`); `IsPos`
  for intensity stereo positions (signed, the accumulator allows
  in-principle unbounded range, conforming streams stay within an
  8-bit window); `NoiseNrg` for PNS noise energies (signed `i32`
  because the seed `global_gain - 346` can be negative).
- `scale_factor_data::AbsoluteScaleFactors` — the per-window-group
  container, matching the outer / inner shape of `ScaleFactorData`.
- `scale_factor_data::NOISE_OFFSET = 90` — §4.6.13 constant that
  positions the PNS-track running register relative to
  `global_gain`. Made `pub` so downstream rate-allocation callers
  can derive the seed without hard-coding the constant.
- `Error::ScaleFactorAccumulatorInvalid` for caller-side bugs the
  accumulator / differentiator cannot represent: outer length
  mismatch with `sfb_cb`; per-group entry count mismatch with the
  non-`ZERO_HCB` band count of the matching `sfb_cb` group;
  variant ↔ codebook mismatch; spectrum-track running value
  escaping `0..=255`; spectrum / intensity / PNS-subsequent delta
  outside `-60..=+60`; first PNS band's initial seed magnitude
  outside the 9-bit `uimsbf` field (`0..=511`); second `NoisePcm`
  in the same frame (`noise_pcm_flag` already cleared);
  `NoiseDpcm` on the first PNS band of the frame.
- Module-level documentation calls out the spec ambiguity between
  the §4.6.2.3.2 illustrative pseudocode (single-track, lumps PNS
  into `last_sf`) and the §4.6.8.1.4 + §4.6.13 prose-level "done
  separately" wording. This crate honours the three-track prose
  interpretation; the rationale is that the §4.6.2.3.2 pseudocode
  is identical in 13818-7 §11.3.2 where PNS does not exist, so the
  MPEG-4 prose §4.6.13 supersedes for PNS bands.
- 37 new integration tests in `tests/scale_factor_accumulator.rs`
  covering: empty / all-`ZERO_HCB` no-op paths; spectrum-only
  ascending sequences; spectrum-track boundary deltas (±60) at
  both ends of the 0..=255 range; intensity-track zero-seed
  independence of `global_gain`; intensity-track boundary deltas;
  PNS first-band PCM seed including 9-bit boundaries (delta 0 and
  511); PNS subsequent-band Huffman delta; frame-scope
  `noise_pcm_flag` invariant across window groups; three-track
  independence under interleaved bands; `ZERO_HCB` skip behaviour;
  cross-window-group accumulator persistence; two hand-pinned
  §4.6.2.3.2 / §4.6.13 spec-pseudocode lockstep tests; every
  `ScaleFactorAccumulatorInvalid` rejection branch (spectrum /
  intensity / PNS-first-seed / PNS-subsequent overflows,
  underflows, variant ↔ codebook mismatch, outer / inner length
  mismatch, decoder-side sf-track 0..=255 overflow / underflow,
  decoder-side PCM-after-flag-clear and Huffman-before-flag-clear);
  a composite EIGHT_SHORT-shape frame with all three tracks
  interleaved across 8 window groups; and a `NOISE_OFFSET` constant
  pin. Suite size grows 227 → 264 tests.

### Added (round 149 — fifth encoder primitive: scale_factor_data parser + writer)

- `scale_factor_data` module: ISO/IEC 14496-3 §4.4.6 / Table 4.53
  (non-resilient branch) plus §4.6.3 / Table 4.A.1 *scalefactor
  Huffman codebook* (codebook 12) — the AAC crate's fifth encode-
  side syntax-element writer. The 121-entry Table 4.A.1 is
  transcribed verbatim from the spec (max length 19 bits, codeword
  for index 60 / delta 0 is the single bit `0`) and is a *complete*
  prefix code (Kraft equality, exhaustively verified by walking all
  `2^19` 19-bit prefixes).
- Public helpers `hcod_sf_encode(dpcm: i8) -> Result<(u8, u32)>`
  and `hcod_sf_decode(reader: &mut BitReader) -> Result<i8>` expose
  the Table 4.A.1 codebook directly for Auditor harnesses and
  fixture cross-checks.
- Public constants `SF_INDEX_OFFSET = -60` (Table 4.150 DPCM range
  centre), `NOISE_PCM_BITS = 9` (Table 4.53 first-PNS seed width),
  `HCOD_SF_NUM_ENTRIES = 121`, `HCOD_SF_MAX_LEN = 19` pin the
  §4.6.3 / Table 4.150 dispatch.
- `ScaleFactorData::parse(reader, sfb_cb)` walks the per-`(g, sfb)`
  non-`ZERO_HCB` subsequence driven by
  `SectionData::sfb_cb`, dispatching between `hcod_sf[]` (ordinary
  spectrum / PNS-after-first / both intensity codebooks 14 and 15)
  and the 9-bit `dpcm_noise_nrg` PCM seed (first PNS band of the
  frame). `noise_pcm_flag` is *frame*-scoped, not group-scoped:
  the first PNS band consumes the seed regardless of which window
  group it lives in.
- `ScaleFactorData::write(writer, sfb_cb)` is the bit-exact inverse.
  Validates per-band variant ↔ codebook classification, DPCM range
  `-60..=+60`, `NoisePcm` 9-bit cap, and the `noise_pcm_flag`
  consumption rule.
- `Error::ScaleFactorDataEncodeInvalid` for caller-side structural
  bugs the writer cannot represent on the wire: `entries.len()`
  differs from `sfb_cb.len()`; a group's entry count does not match
  the non-`ZERO_HCB` band count of its `sfb_cb` group; a variant
  paired with the wrong codebook (Intensity on a spectrum band,
  NoisePcm on a non-PNS band, NoiseDpcm on the first PNS band,
  Dpcm on an intensity / PNS band); a second NoisePcm in the same
  frame (`noise_pcm_flag` already cleared); a DPCM delta outside
  `-60..=+60`; a NoisePcm magnitude exceeding the 9-bit field cap
  (`> 0x1FF`).
- The §4.6.2.3.2 `last_sf = global_gain` accumulator that converts
  the transmitted DPCM deltas to absolute `sf[g][sfb] ∈ 0..=255`
  is **not** performed — it needs `global_gain` and is a per-AOT
  decoder step the back-end will own (with the symmetric `dpcm
  = sf[g][sfb] - last_sf` step on the encoder rate-allocation
  side).
- The §4.4.6 error-resilient branch (`aacScalefactorDataResilienceFlag
  == 1` → RVLC with `rev_global_gain`, `sf_concealment`,
  `length_of_rvlc_sf`, `length_of_rvlc_escapes`, etc.) is **not**
  implemented; ER AAC-LD / scalable profiles will need a sibling
  `scale_factor_data_rvlc()` module.
- 23 new integration tests in `tests/scale_factor_data.rs`
  covering: empty / all-`ZERO_HCB` no-op paths; single-band
  spectrum / intensity / PNS-seed / PNS-Huffman cases; frame-scope
  `noise_pcm_flag` invariant across window groups; exhaustive
  per-DPCM-value bit-length agreement against Table 4.A.1; a
  mixed-content frame with all four variants and ZERO_HCB skips;
  EIGHT_SHORT-style 8-group iteration; hand-pinned wire-byte
  assertions (single-bit `0x00`, `dpcm_noise_nrg = 0x1AB` →
  `[0xD5, 0x80]` MSB-first); every writer-rejection branch
  (outer length / extra / missing entries, variant ↔ band
  mismatch, second NoisePcm, NoiseDpcm-first-PNS, DPCM out-of-
  range, NoisePcm overflow); parse underflow on the PCM seed; and
  the exhaustive `hcod_sf_decode` completeness test (every 19-bit
  prefix decodes successfully — Kraft equality verification).
- 5 new module-level unit tests covering: known Table 4.A.1 rows
  (`HCOD_SF[60] = (1, 0)`, etc.); prefix-free transcription
  regression guard; `dpcm = 0` collapsing to a single bit;
  encode-boundary rejection at `-61` / `+61`; and the full
  encode→decode round-trip for every legal DPCM value `-60..=+60`.

### Added (round 146 — fourth encoder primitive: tns_data parser + writer)

- `tns_data` module: ISO/IEC 14496-3 §4.4.6 / Table 4.54 `tns_data()`
  parser **and** encoder primitive — the AAC crate's fourth encode-
  side syntax-element writer. `TnsData::parse(reader, window_sequence)`
  walks every transform window (`num_windows` = 8 for
  `EIGHT_SHORT_SEQUENCE`, 1 otherwise) and reads `n_filt[w]` with the
  §4.6.9.2 Table 4.155 size switch (1 bit short / 2 bits long), an
  optional `coef_res[w]` (when `n_filt[w] > 0`), then per-filter
  `length[w][filt]` (4 / 6 bits), `order[w][filt]` (3 / 5 bits), and —
  when `order > 0` — `direction`, `coef_compress`, and `order` ×
  `coef[i]` unsigned magnitudes whose width is
  `coef_bits = (3 + coef_res) − coef_compress` per §4.6.9.3.
  `TnsData::write(writer, window_sequence)` is the bit-exact inverse.
  Public helpers `field_widths(window_sequence)`,
  `num_windows(window_sequence)`, and `coef_bits(coef_res,
  coef_compress)` expose the Table 4.155 / §4.5.2.3.4 / §4.6.9.3
  selection rules; public constants `N_FILT_BITS_{SHORT,LONG}`,
  `LENGTH_BITS_{SHORT,LONG}`, `ORDER_BITS_{SHORT,LONG}`,
  `COEF_RES_BITS`, `DIRECTION_BITS`, `COEF_COMPRESS_BITS` pin the
  per-table widths. The §4.6.9.3 `tns_decode_coef` LPC reconstruction
  (signed conversion, `iqfac` arcsine inverse-quantisation, Levinson-
  style conversion to LPC) and the §4.6.9.3 `tns_ar_filter` all-pole
  pass over the spectrum are **not** performed here — they need the
  spectral context that arrives with the per-AOT IMDCT back-end. The
  §4.6.9.4 `TNS_MAX_ORDER` / `TNS_MAX_BANDS` clamp tables (Tables
  4.156 / 4.157) are similarly the decoder reconstruction layer's
  responsibility; the parser surfaces the literal wire `order` /
  `length` values regardless.
- `Error::TnsDataEncodeInvalid` for caller-side structural bugs the
  writer cannot represent on the wire: `windows.len()` differs from
  `num_windows(window_sequence)` (1 for long sequences, 8 for
  `EIGHT_SHORT_SEQUENCE`); per-window `filters.len()` exceeds the
  `n_filt` field cap (1 on `EIGHT_SHORT_SEQUENCE`, 3 otherwise); a
  filter's `length` exceeds the `length` field cap (15 / 63); a
  filter's `order` exceeds the `order` field cap (7 / 31); the
  `coef[]` length differs from `order`; a coefficient magnitude
  exceeds the `(1 << coef_bits) - 1` cap; or a zero-`order` filter
  carries a non-default `direction` / `coef_compress` that would
  silently be dropped on the wire (those fields are not transmitted
  when `order == 0`).
- 38 new integration tests in `tests/tns_data.rs` covering empty
  windows for every `WindowSequence` variant, every
  `(coef_res, coef_compress)` combination on the long-window branch
  (verifying `coef_bits ∈ {2, 3, 4}`), zero-order filters that skip
  the entire `direction`/`compress`/`coef[]` tail, mixed zero- and
  non-zero-order filters in the same window, max-`n_filt` long
  (3 filters) and short (1 filter) cases, max-field-width short
  windows (length=15 / order=7 / 4-bit coef on all 8 windows),
  heterogeneous `EIGHT_SHORT` packing, three hand-pinned wire-layout
  assertions (one for a 19-bit single-filter long-window block, two
  zero-filter pins for long and short), field-width / helper sanity
  matching Table 4.155 + §4.5.2.3.4 + §4.6.9.3 dispatch, every
  `TnsDataEncodeInvalid` rejection branch (wrong window count,
  `n_filt` / `length` / `order` overflow on both long and short,
  `coef[]` length mismatch, coef-value overflow at every
  `coef_bits` tier, zero-order with `direction`/`compress` set),
  parser unexpected-end at both the `n_filt` and inside-filter
  positions, and a back-to-back two-block sequence that asserts the
  parser / writer carry no inter-block state. Suite size grows
  161 → 199 tests.

### Added (round 142 — third encoder primitive: pulse_data parser + writer)

- `pulse_data` module: ISO/IEC 14496-3 §4.4.6.3 / Table 4.7
  `pulse_data()` parser **and** encoder primitive. `PulseData::parse`
  reads the 2-bit `number_pulse`, 6-bit `pulse_start_sfb`, and
  `number_pulse + 1` `(5-bit pulse_offset, 4-bit pulse_amp)` records
  into a [`PulseData`] struct; `PulseData::write` is the bit-exact
  inverse. Every field is fixed-width; no Huffman tables, no
  `swb_offset` dependence, no surrounding-element state. Public
  constants `PULSE_OFFSET_BITS` (5), `PULSE_AMP_BITS` (4), and
  `MAX_PULSES` (4) pin the Table 4.7 widths for downstream callers.
  A `PulseData::number_pulse()` accessor returns the wire value
  (`pulses.len() - 1`). The §4.6.13 reconstruction loop (`k +=
  swb_offset[pulse_start_sfb] + pulse_offset[j]; x_quant[…] ±=
  pulse_amp[j]`) is **not** performed — it needs the
  `swb_offset_long_window[]` table and the post-Huffman `x_quant`
  array that arrive with `spectral_data()`.
- `Error::PulseDataEncodeInvalid` for caller-side structural bugs the
  writer cannot represent on the wire: empty `pulses` vector (the
  loop bound is `number_pulse + 1 >= 1`), `pulses.len() > MAX_PULSES`
  (2-bit `number_pulse` field cap of 4), `pulse_start_sfb > 0x3f`
  (6-bit overflow), `Pulse::offset > 0x1f` (5-bit overflow), or
  `Pulse::amp > 0x0f` (4-bit overflow).
- 22 new integration tests in `tests/pulse_data.rs` covering single-
  pulse smallest legal block, every legal pulse count (1..=4),
  wire-field-at-max (per individual field and all fields
  simultaneously), two hand-pinned wire-layout assertions (one
  synthetic 17-bit layout for a `(start=42, offset=21, amp=5)`
  single-pulse block; one realistic 26-bit layout for a
  `(start=32, [(3,2), (17,4)])` two-pulse block), every
  `PulseDataEncodeInvalid` rejection branch, parser unexpected-end at
  both the header and the pulse-loop positions, accessor / constant
  sanity, and a back-to-back two-block sequence that asserts the
  parser / writer carry no inter-block state. Suite size grows 139
  → 161 tests.

### Added (round 140 — second encoder primitive: ics_info writer)

- `ics_info::IcsInfo::write(writer, audio_object_type,
  sampling_frequency_index, common_window)` — the inverse of the
  round-129 `IcsInfo::parse` and the crate's second encode-side
  syntax-element writer. Emits the bit-exact ISO/IEC 14496-3 §4.4.6
  Table 4.6 stream: `ics_reserved_bit` (1 bit), `window_sequence`
  (2 bits), `window_shape` (1 bit), then either `max_sfb` (4 bits) +
  `scale_factor_grouping` (7 bits) for `EIGHT_SHORT_SEQUENCE`, or
  `max_sfb` (6 bits) + `predictor_data_present` (1 bit) plus the
  per-AOT predictor / LTP body for every other window sequence.
  Main-AOT (1) predictor side info covers `predictor_reset` +
  optional `predictor_reset_group_number` (5 bits) +
  `prediction_used[]` capped at `min(max_sfb, PRED_SFB_MAX[fs_index])`.
  Non-Main AOTs use the LTP branch, including the second
  `ltp_data_present` (+ optional paired `ltp_data()`) when
  `common_window == true`.
- `ics_info::write_ltp_data(writer, ltp, audio_object_type,
  window_sequence, max_sfb)` — Table 4.55 `ltp_data()` body writer.
  Covers both the non-LD 11-bit-lag form (with the `EIGHT_SHORT`
  omission of `ltp_long_used[]`) and the ER-AAC-LD (AOT 23)
  delta-coded form (`lag_update` flag + optional 10-bit `lag` + 3-bit
  `coef` + `long_used[]` capped at `MAX_LTP_LONG_SFB`).
- `Error::IcsInfoEncodeInvalid` for caller-side structural bugs the
  writer cannot represent on the wire: `max_sfb` exceeds its 4-/6-bit
  field width, `scale_factor_grouping` missing on EIGHT_SHORT or
  present on long, `predictor_data_present == true` on EIGHT_SHORT,
  a predictor / LTP body slot populated on the wrong AOT branch or
  on the predictor-absent branch, paired-channel LTP populated
  without `common_window`, predictor `reset_group_number` parity
  not matching the `reset` bit, `prediction_used[]` length not
  equal to `min(max_sfb, PRED_SFB_MAX[fs_index])`, `long_used[]`
  length not equal to `min(max_sfb, MAX_LTP_LONG_SFB)`, or a
  numeric field (`coef`, `lag`, `reset_group_number`,
  `scale_factor_grouping`) exceeding its wire-slot width.
- 35 new self-roundtrip integration tests in
  `tests/ics_info_encode.rs` — long branch (LC, KBD, `LongStart`,
  `LongStop` with reserved-bit set, `max_sfb == 0`), EIGHT_SHORT
  branch (no grouping, all grouped, mixed grouping mask), Main
  predictor (no reset, with reset, `PRED_SFB_MAX` cap), non-LD LTP
  (long, `MAX_LTP_LONG_SFB` cap, short via direct `write_ltp_data`
  call), ER-AAC-LD LTP (with and without `lag_update`),
  common-window paired LTP (present and absent), every
  `IcsInfoEncodeInvalid` rejection branch, and a hand-pinned
  wire-layout assertion (`buf[0] == 0x06`, `buf[1] == 0x40` for a
  25-band LC long sequence). Suite size grows 104 → 139 tests.

### Added (round 137 — first encoder primitive: section_data writer)

- `section_data::SectionData::write(writer, window_sequence, max_sfb)`
  — the inverse of `SectionData::parse` and the AAC crate's first
  encode-side syntax-element writer. Emits the bit-exact ISO/IEC
  14496-3 §4.4.6 / ISO/IEC 13818-7 §6.3 Table 17 stream that the
  existing parser reads back: per window group, for each section,
  4-bit `sect_cb` followed by an inverse-§6.3 `sect_len_incr`
  sequence — while remaining `sect_len >= sect_esc_val`, emit
  `sect_esc_val` and subtract; emit the residual (which is in
  `[0, sect_esc_val)`) once at the end. The "greater than or equal
  to" boundary forces a trailing non-escape `sect_len_incr == 0`
  whenever the section length is an exact multiple of
  `sect_esc_val`, preserving the parser's `break-on-non-escape`
  invariant.
- `Error::SectionDataEncodeInvalid` for caller-side structural bugs
  the writer cannot represent on the wire: non-contiguous per-group
  sections, gaps or overlaps in band coverage, `sect_cb` exceeding
  the 4-bit field, or zero-length sections.
- 18 new self-roundtrip integration tests in
  `tests/section_data_encode.rs` — long branch (no escape, single
  escape, double escape, exact-multiple terminator, double exact
  multiple), EIGHT_SHORT branch (no escape, single escape,
  exact-multiple terminator), multi-window-group with intensity and
  PNS codebooks, `max_sfb == 0` empty list, every
  `SectionDataEncodeInvalid` rejection branch, and a hand-pinned
  wire-layout assertion (`buf[0] == 0xB1`, `buf[1] == 0x91`,
  `buf[2] == 0x00` for `[(11, 3), (2, 4)]` with `max_sfb=7`). Each
  test feeds the encoded buffer back through the existing parser
  and asserts both structural equality and matching bit position.
  Suite size grows 86 → 104 tests.

### Added (round 133 — Phase 2: section_data)

- `section_data` module: ISO/IEC 14496-3 §4.4.6 / ISO/IEC 13818-7
  §6.3 Table 17 `section_data()` parser. Walks each window group's
  run-length-coded section list — reading `sect_cb` (4 bits) and
  accumulating `sect_len` from `sect_len_incr` fields with the §6.3
  escape mechanism (3-bit field / `sect_esc_val == 7` for
  `EIGHT_SHORT_SEQUENCE`, 5-bit field / `sect_esc_val == 31`
  otherwise). Produces the ordered per-group `Section { codebook,
  start, end }` lists, the flattened `sfb_cb[g][sfb]` codebook map,
  and a `num_sec(group)` accessor. Every field is fixed-width — no
  Huffman decode.
- Codebook constants `ZERO_HCB` (0), `FIRST_PAIR_HCB` (5),
  `ESC_HCB` (11), `NOISE_HCB` (13), `INTENSITY_HCB2` (14),
  `INTENSITY_HCB` (15) per ISO/IEC 13818-7 §9.2.2, plus a
  `Codebook` classifier (QUAD / PAIR dimension + `unsigned_cb[]`
  signedness per Table 59, with `is_intensity()` / `is_noise()` /
  `is_zero()` predicates) for downstream `scale_factor_data()` /
  `spectral_data()` dispatch.
- `Error::SectionDataOverrun` for a non-conforming `sect_len` that
  would extend a section past `max_sfb`.
- 17 new integration tests covering single / multi-section long and
  EIGHT_SHORT branches, single and double escape coding, multi
  window-group parsing, `max_sfb == 0`, overrun rejection,
  unexpected-end, the codebook constants and `Codebook`
  classification, and the fixtures-doc reference section trace —
  bringing the suite to 86 tests.

### Added (round 129 — Phase 2 begin: ics_info)

- `ics_info` module: ISO/IEC 14496-3 §4.4.6 Table 4.6
  `ics_info()` parser. Surfaces `ics_reserved_bit`,
  `window_sequence` (Table 4.128), `window_shape`, `max_sfb`
  (4-bit / 6-bit branching on `EIGHT_SHORT_SEQUENCE`),
  `scale_factor_grouping` mask, the Main AOT's `predictor_data()`
  body (`predictor_reset` + `predictor_reset_group_number` +
  `prediction_used[]`), and every non-Main AOT's `ltp_data_present`
  chain. `ltp_data()` (Table 4.55) is fully parsed for both the
  ER-AAC-LD (AOT 23) and non-LD forms, including the second
  `ltp_data_present` for CPE common-window streams. The parser
  also computes the §4.5.2.3.4 derivations (`num_windows`,
  `num_window_groups`, `window_group_length[]`, `num_swb`) and
  exposes them as struct fields plus a public
  `derive_window_grouping()` helper.
- Sample-rate count tables: `NUM_SWB_LONG_WINDOW[12]`,
  `NUM_SWB_SHORT_WINDOW[12]`, and `PRED_SFB_MAX[12]` constants —
  transcribed from ISO/IEC 14496-3 Tables 4.129–4.141 and ISO/IEC
  13818-7 Table 62.
- `Error::IcsInfoUnsupportedSampleRateIndex(u8)` for the case
  where a caller invokes `IcsInfo::parse` with the 24-bit
  explicit-rate escape (or a reserved index) without first
  resolving it to a standard 0..=11 index.
- 26 new integration tests covering long / EIGHT_SHORT / KBD,
  grouping-mask edge cases, Main predictor, LTP, ER-AAC-LD LTP,
  CPE common-window LTP, and unexpected-end — bringing the suite
  to 69 tests.

### Added (round 126 — configuration layer)

- `asc` module: ISO/IEC 14496-3 §1.6.2.1 `AudioSpecificConfig` parser
  + §4.4.1 `GASpecificConfig` body for every General Audio
  `audioObjectType` (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23).
  Hierarchical SBR (AOT 5) and PS (AOT 29) outer-wrappers are
  unwrapped and surfaced as `sbr_present` / `ps_present` plus the
  extension sampling-frequency index. `samplingFrequencyIndex` 24-bit
  escape (`0xf`) is honoured; `GetAudioObjectType` 5/6-bit escape is
  honoured. Non-GA AOTs return `Error::UnsupportedAot`.
- `pce` module: ISO/IEC 14496-3 §4.4.1.1 / ISO/IEC 13818-7 §8.5
  `program_config_element()` parser — every wire field is preserved
  (`front` / `side` / `back` / `lfe` / `assoc` / `cc` element
  lists, mono / stereo / matrix mix-down hints, comment field).
  `byte_alignment()` is configurable via the `origin_bit_offset`
  parameter to honour Table 4.2 Note 1 (ASC-relative alignment when
  the PCE is embedded inside an `AudioSpecificConfig`).
- `raw_data_block::Element::ProgramConfig(Pce)`: the walker now
  fully parses a PCE element inside a raw_data_block (previously
  `Error::UnsupportedElementSkip(5)`).
- 20 new integration tests (13 ASC, 7 PCE), bringing the suite to
  43 tests.

### Added (round 121 — Phase 1 syntactic skeleton)

- `adts` module: ISO/IEC 13818-7 §1.A.2.2.1–.2 ADTS fixed + variable
  header parser. Surfaces sync, ID, `protection_absent`, profile,
  `sampling_frequency_index`, `channel_configuration`,
  `aac_frame_length`, `adts_buffer_fullness`, and the resolved
  `number_of_raw_data_blocks_in_frame` (decoded as `N`, not the wire
  `N − 1`). Reserved `sampling_frequency_index` values are rejected;
  CRC presence is confirmed but the CRC value is not validated yet.
- `raw_data_block` module: ISO/IEC 14496-3 §4.4.2.1 syntactic walker
  that iterates `id_syn_ele` and recognises all eight element types
  (SCE / CPE / CCE / LFE / DSE / PCE / FIL / END). FIL and DSE bodies
  are fully skipped per §4.4.2.7 / §4.4.2.5; SCE/CPE/CCE/LFE emit
  the element header (`kind`, `element_instance_tag`) without
  parsing the body; PCE returns `Error::UnsupportedElementSkip`;
  END byte-aligns the reader and terminates the block.
- 23 unit/integration tests covering the new surface, including a
  synthetic SCE-FIL-END round-trip that wraps the walker inside a
  real ADTS frame.

### Erased

- Prior master history was force-erased on **2026-05-24** under
  Hat-3 cold enforcement of the workspace clean-room policy
  (`docs/IMPLEMENTOR_ROUND.md`). The retired implementation included
  encoder-source comments describing matching an external reference
  encoder's behaviour by citing a specific source file of that
  implementation. The clean-room policy forbids consulting any
  external implementation's source for any reason, regardless of
  licensing or technical merit.

### Reset

- Crate reduced to a minimal `oxideav_core::register!` stub. Every
  public API returns `Error::NotImplemented`. The crates.io version
  (`0.1.2`) is preserved on the new master to avoid breaking any
  downstream version pins; the published versions on crates.io will
  be yanked by the maintainer.

### Next

- Clean-room re-implementation against the staged ISO/IEC 14496-3 /
  13818-7 AAC specifications (numeric tables and decode behaviour
  read only from the standards) in a future round.
