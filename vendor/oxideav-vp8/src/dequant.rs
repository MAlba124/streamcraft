//! VP8 §14.1 dequantization scaling and the bitstream→dequant wrapper.
//!
//! RFC 6386 §14.1 (page 76) multiplies every decoded (quantized)
//! coefficient by one of **six** dequantization factors, chosen by plane
//! (Y1, Y2, chroma) and position (DC = coefficient 0, AC = coefficients
//! 1..=15). The two base lookup tables `dc_qlookup[128]` / `ac_qlookup[128]`
//! live in [`crate::inverse_transform`] (transcribed verbatim from §14.1
//! page 77 / §20.3 `dequant_data.h`). §14.1 page 77 states that the Y1 DC
//! and Y1 AC factors are *"directly used"* from those tables, but the Y2
//! and chroma factors *"undergo either scaling or clamping before the
//! multiplies. Details ... can be found in related lookup functions in
//! dixie.c (Section 20.4)."*
//!
//! Section 20.4 (`dixie.c`) is part of RFC 6386, so the scaling / clamping
//! rules it gives are in-spec. The reference `dequant_init` (§20.4 page
//! 144) computes the six factors as:
//!
//! ```text
//! q = quant_hdr->q_index;                        // = yac_qi (§9.6)
//! if (seg->enabled)
//!     q = seg->abs ? seg->quant_idx[i]
//!                  : q + seg->quant_idx[i];       // §10 per-segment override
//! Y1.dc = dc_q(q + y1_dc_delta_q);
//! Y1.ac = ac_q(q);
//! UV.dc = dc_q(q + uv_dc_delta_q);   if (UV.dc > 132) UV.dc = 132;
//! UV.ac = ac_q(q + uv_ac_delta_q);
//! Y2.dc = dc_q(q + y2_dc_delta_q) * 2;
//! Y2.ac = ac_q(q + y2_ac_delta_q) * 155 / 100;   if (Y2.ac < 8) Y2.ac = 8;
//! ```
//!
//! where `dc_q(q) = dc_qlookup[clamp_q(q)]`, `ac_q(q) = ac_qlookup[clamp_q(q)]`,
//! and `clamp_q` saturates the index into `0..=127` (§20.4 page 143).
//!
//! This module turns those rules into:
//!
//! * [`MbDequantFactors`] — the six factors for one macroblock's segment.
//! * [`MbDequantFactors::from_quant_indices`] — the frame-level (no
//!   segmentation override) derivation from a [`QuantIndices`].
//! * [`MbDequantFactors::for_segment`] — the §10 per-segment override
//!   (delta or absolute) on top of the frame-level baseline.
//! * [`MbDequantFactors::dequantize`] — apply the factors to a raw
//!   [`MbCoeffs`] in place (Y2 DC/AC, the sixteen Y sub-blocks, the four U
//!   and four V chroma sub-blocks), each coefficient's product computed in
//!   `i32` and stored back as `i16` (§14.1 page 76 *"computed and stored
//!   using 16-bit signed integers"*).
//! * [`decode_and_dequantize_mb`] — the bitstream→dequant wrapper that
//!   feeds [`decode_keyframe`]: it calls [`decode_mb_coeffs`] to recover
//!   the raw quantized [`MbCoeffs`] from the token partition, then applies
//!   the supplied [`MbDequantFactors`], producing the pre-dequantized
//!   [`MbCoeffs`] that the per-macroblock reconstruction orchestrators (and
//!   thus [`decode_keyframe`]) consume.
//!
