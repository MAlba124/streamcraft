//! Per-macroblock reconstruction orchestration (RFC 6386 §14.2).
//!
//! This module is the glue that ties together the bitstream pieces
//! already landed in earlier rounds:
//!
//! * §13 token decode (`dct_tokens` / `decode_block`) → caller produces
//!   raw 4×4 sub-block coefficient arrays;
//! * §14.1 dequantization (`inverse_transform::dequant_block`) → caller
//!   multiplies each sub-block's coefficients by the DC / AC factors;
//! * §14.3 inverse WHT (`inverse_transform::inverse_wht_4x4`) → applied
//!   here when the Y2 block is present;
//! * §14.4 inverse DCT (`inverse_transform::inverse_dct_4x4`) → applied
//!   here per Y / U / V sub-block;
//! * §11 mode decode (`macroblock::parse_key_frame_macroblock_modes`)
//!   selects which §12 intra-prediction kernel applies;
//! * §12 intra-prediction kernels (`intra_predict::predict_y16x16` /
//!   `predict_uv8x8`) → applied here;
//! * §14.5 summation (`inverse_transform::add_residue_4x4`) → applied
//!   here to fold the per-sub-block residue back into the predicted
//!   pixels.
//!
//! ## Scope (single-MB orchestrator)
//!
//! [`decode_keyframe_mb_non_bpred`] reconstructs one macroblock whose
//! 16×16 luma mode is one of the four §12.3-16×16 modes
//! ([`IntraYMode::Dc`] / [`IntraYMode::V`] / [`IntraYMode::H`] /
//! [`IntraYMode::Tm`]). It does **not** drive `B_PRED` macroblocks.
//!
//! [`decode_keyframe_mb_bpred`] is the companion entry point for the
//! `B_PRED` luma mode (§11.3 / §12.3). Unlike the 16×16 modes, a
//! `B_PRED` macroblock predicts each of its sixteen 4×4 luma sub-blocks
//! independently, and — critically — each sub-block's prediction reads
//! the **already-reconstructed** pixels (prediction + residue) of the
//! sub-blocks above and to its left. The orchestrator therefore cannot
//! predict the whole plane first and add residue afterward; it must
//! interleave predict → inverse-DCT → add-residue **per sub-block** in
//! raster order so that each sub-block's reconstructed pixels are
//! visible as the next sub-block's neighbours (this mirrors the §20.14
//! reference decoder's in-place `b_pred()` loop). The chroma planes of a
//! `B_PRED` macroblock still use one of the four 8×8 §12.2 modes, so
//! that part of the recipe is identical to the non-`B_PRED` path.
//!
//! Neither orchestrator walks the raster of macroblocks across a frame;
//! that walker sits on top of these primitives and is the next layer up.
//!
//! ### §12.3 per-sub-block neighbour evolution
//!
//! The working luma buffer is a `B_PRED`-private macroblock-sized array
//! with a one-pixel top border row and a one-pixel left border column
//! (so each sub-block can read `above` / `left` / the top-left pixel `P`
//! at constant stride), plus a four-pixel "above-right extension" tacked
//! onto the right end of the border row. Each sub-block's `above` is the
//! 8-pixel strip in the row immediately above it (the four pixels
//! directly above plus the four above-and-to-the-right), `left` is the
//! 4-pixel column immediately to its left, and `P` is the pixel at
//! `(-1, -1)` relative to the sub-block. After [`predict_b4x4`] writes
//! the prediction, the sub-block's residue is inverse-DCT'd and added
//! in place, so the next sub-block in raster order sees reconstructed
//! pixels.
//!
//! ### §12.3 right-edge "above-right" fixup
//!
//! Because whole macroblocks are reconstructed in raster order, the
//! four pixels above-and-to-the-right of sub-blocks 7, 11, and 15 have
//! not been built when those sub-blocks are predicted. Per §12.3 page
//! 55 all four right-edge sub-blocks (3, 7, 11, 15) instead share the
//! four pixels above-and-to-the-right of sub-block 3 — frame positions
//! `(-1, 16)..=(-1, 19)`. The orchestrator copies those four pixels
//! down into the border slots above sub-blocks 7, 11, and 15 (the
//! `copy_down` step of the reference decoder) before the sub-block walk
//! begins. The caller supplies the four `(-1, 16)..=(-1, 19)` values in
//! [`MbNeighbors::y_above_right`]; on the top macroblock row they are
//! 127, and for the rightmost macroblock in a non-top row they are the
//! value at `(-1, 15)` (the caller computes that clamp).
//!
//! ## Inputs
//!
//! The caller supplies pre-dequantized 16-bit coefficient arrays for
//! the 25th (Y2) block, the sixteen Y sub-blocks, and the eight chroma
//! sub-blocks. The dequant step is the caller's responsibility for
//! two reasons:
//!
//! 1. Y1 dequant factors (`Y1DequantFactors`) are already exposed by
//!    [`inverse_transform`]; pulling them in here would force a choice
//!    on the caller about quantiser-index plumbing that the §14.2
//!    orchestration step itself does not care about.
//! 2. The Y2 / chroma dequant scaling and clamping that RFC 6386 §14.1
//!    defers to the reference decoder `dixie.c` source is currently a
//!    documented spec gap (filed against `docs/video/vp8/`) — keeping
//!    that gap **out** of this orchestrator's signature means this
//!    module lands today without depending on the gap being filled.
//!    When the gap is filled, a follow-up convenience entry point that
//!    accepts raw tokens + a quantiser-index bundle can wrap this
//!    function.
//!
//! The caller also supplies the neighbouring pixel context that the
//! §12 kernels read (the 16-pixel `above` / `left` strips and the
//! top-left pixel for Y, the 8-pixel pair for each chroma plane).
//!
//! ## §14.2 procedure (transcribed)
//!
//! 1. If the Y2 block exists (Y mode ≠ `B_PRED` and ≠ `SPLITMV`):
//!    inverse-WHT the Y2 coefficients and seed each Y sub-block's
//!    coefficient 0 with the matching WHT-output element. This is the
//!    §14.2 first-paragraph rule: *"the element of the result at row
//!    `i`, column `j` is used as the 0th coefficient of the Y subblock
//!    at position `(i, j)`, that is, the Y subblock whose index is
//!    `(i * 4) + j`."*
//! 2. Inverse-DCT all sixteen Y sub-blocks and all eight chroma
//!    sub-blocks (§14.2 second paragraph: *"All 24 of these inversions
//!    are independent of each other."*)
//! 3. Apply the §12 intra-prediction kernel selected by the §11 mode
//!    record, producing the prediction buffer.
//! 4. Sum the prediction and the residue with `clamp255` (§14.5).
//!
//! ## `mb_skip_coeff`
//!
//! When the §11 mode record's `mb_skip_coeff` is true, the entire
//! residue is zero by definition — token decode is skipped, the Y2
//! block is absent, and the reconstructed pixels equal the prediction
//! exactly. This orchestrator honours that short-circuit and avoids
//! the wasted WHT / DCT / summation cycles for skip MBs.
