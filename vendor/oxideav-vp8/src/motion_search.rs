//! Encoder-side integer-pixel motion-search primitives.
//!
//! VP8's bitstream (RFC 6386) is silent on how an encoder picks its
//! motion vectors — §2 explicitly notes that the standard "does not
//! specify a particular encoding algorithm". The only on-wire constraint
//! is the §17.1 range: each motion-vector component is a signed integer
//! in `[-1023, +1023]` quarter-pixels of luma displacement, with whole
//! pixels at multiples of 4 (§17.1 page 108).
//!
//! This module is the smallest piece of infrastructure that a non-zero
//! MV codepath needs: given a source 16×16 luma block and a reference
//! plane, return a whole-pixel candidate MV that minimises the
//! sum-of-absolute-differences (SAD) between the source and the
//! reference patch the MV would select.
//!
//! ## Scope
//!
//! * **Whole-pixel descent followed by §18.3 half-pixel and quarter-
//!   pixel refinement.** [`small_diamond_search_luma`] finds the best
//!   integer-pixel MV via a 4-neighbour descent against the §20.14
//!   edge-replicating fetch primitive; [`half_pixel_refine_luma`] then
//!   probes the 8 half-pixel offsets around that whole-pixel result;
//!   [`quarter_pixel_refine_luma`] then probes the 8 quarter-pixel
//!   offsets around the half-pixel result. Each sub-pixel candidate is
//!   evaluated through the §18.3 six-tap synthesis the decoder runs
//!   (`version == 0` bicubic tap set), keyed by `(stored_luma_mv(mv) &
//!   7)` — so a §17 quarter-pixel MV of magnitude 1 selects the
//!   `1/4`-position row of the §18.3 filter table (`{ 2, -11, 108, 36,
//!   -8, 1 }`), magnitude 3 the `3/4`-position row, and so on. The
//!   returned MV is always on the §17 quarter-pixel grid (the on-wire
//!   resolution of `mv` per §17.1) and inside `[MV_MIN, MV_MAX]`.
//! * **Luma only.** The chroma plane is not sampled — the §18.1
//!   `chroma_mv = avg(v, v, v, v)` derivation means a half-pixel luma
//!   MV maps to a sub-pixel chroma MV by construction; sampling chroma
//!   SAD per candidate would noticeably increase per-iteration cost
//!   without typically changing the picked MV.
//! * **Small-diamond integer descent.** A 4-neighbour (N / S / E / W at
//!   ±1 whole pixel) descent from a caller-supplied center, terminating
//!   when no neighbour improves the SAD or after `max_iters` iterations.
//!   Larger integer patterns (hex, square, diamond-with-radius-N) are
//!   deferred.
//!
//! ## §17.1 range clamp
//!
//! All candidate MVs are clamped into `[MV_MIN, MV_MAX]` =
//! `[-1023, +1023]` quarter-pixels before the reference fetch. The
//! underlying §20.14 `build_mc_border` edge replication inside
//! [`crate::motion_comp::fetch_block_whole_pixel`] /
//! [`crate::motion_comp::fetch_block_halo`] keeps a candidate that
//! walks the patch (or the sixtap halo) off the picture safe: the fetch
//! just reads the nearest in-bounds row / column. The §17.1 clamp is
//! applied because anything outside that range cannot be coded in the
//! bitstream regardless of whether the reference fetch would be valid.
//!
//! ## Reference
//!
//! * RFC 6386 §2 — encoder algorithm not specified.
//! * RFC 6386 §17.1 — MV component range `[-1023, +1023]`, whole pixels
//!   at multiples of 4 (i.e. half-pixel = multiples of 2 = the
//!   [`HALF_PIXEL_STEP`] grid).
//! * RFC 6386 §18.1 — `stored_luma_mv` doubling that turns a §17
//!   quarter-pixel MV into the §18 eighth-pixel resolution the §18.3
//!   filter table indexes.
//! * RFC 6386 §18.3 — six-tap sub-pixel interpolation (`version == 0`
//!   bicubic / `version != 0` bilinear); the sub-pixel refinements run
//!   the MB-batched [`crate::motion_comp::sixtap_mb_luma`] synthesis,
//!   byte-exact with the per-sub-block `filter_block_4x4` tiling the
//!   decoder reproduces.
//! * RFC 6386 §20.14 — `build_mc_border` edge replication for fetches
//!   that walk off the picture.
