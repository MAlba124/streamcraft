//! VP8 dequantization and inverse transforms per RFC 6386 §14.
//!
//! This module implements the pieces of §14 that RFC 6386 specifies
//! **completely in its body**, all operating on small caller-supplied
//! arrays in raster (natural) order:
//!
//! * **§14.1 dequantization tables** — the `dc_qlookup[128]` /
//!   `ac_qlookup[128]` tables transcribed verbatim, plus a Y-plane
//!   dequant-factor computation. The spec states (§14.1 page 77):
//!   *"Lookup values from the above two tables are directly used in the
//!   DC and AC coefficients in Y1, respectively."* So the Y1-DC factor
//!   is `dc_qlookup[clamp(yac_qi + ydc_delta)]` and the Y1-AC factor is
//!   `ac_qlookup[clamp(yac_qi)]`, where the qindex is clamped to the
//!   `0..=127` table range. The Y2 and chroma factors require the
//!   scaling / clamping rules from §14.1 / the §20.4 `dixie.c` annex
//!   (which is part of RFC 6386); those six-factor derivations live in
//!   the [`crate::dequant`] module. This module provides only the raw
//!   lookup tables and the Y1-only factor helper.
//! * **§14.3 inverse WHT** — `inverse_wht_4x4`, a faithful port of the
//!   `vp8_short_inv_walsh4x4_c` C source given in the RFC body, plus
//!   `inverse_wht_4x4_dc_only`, the single-DC fast path
//!   (`vp8_short_inv_walsh4x4_1_c`).
//! * **§14.4 inverse DCT** — `inverse_dct_4x4`, a faithful port of the
//!   `short_idct4x4llm_c` C source (the two `sqrt(2)·cos(pi/8)` /
//!   `sqrt(2)·sin(pi/8)` fixed-point constants, two passes of 1-D
//!   inverse DCT).
//! * **§14.5 summation** — `add_residue` / `clamp255`, summing a
//!   prediction block and a residue block with the §14.5 saturating
//!   `clamp255`.
//!
//! All transform inputs/outputs are 16-bit signed integers exactly as
//! the spec mandates (*"all stored as arrays of 16-bit signed
//! integers"*), and the spec notes a conforming decoder must reproduce
//! the rounding bit-for-bit.
//!
//! # What is NOT in this module (out of scope for §14 standalone)
//!
//! * The **zig-zag → raster reordering** of the §13 scan-ordered
//!   coefficients. §13 says the coefficients "follow a so-called
//!   zig-zag order" (§13 page 60) but the spec body never gives the
//!   permutation array — it lives only in the reference `idct_add.c`
//!   (Section 20.8), which is off-limits. This is a documented gap; the
//!   per-macroblock integration round must supply the reordering before
//!   calling the raster-order transforms here.
//! * The **Y2-DC / Y2-AC / chroma-DC / chroma-AC dequant factors** —
//!   the scaling and clamping rules from §14.1 / §20.4. These now live
//!   in [`crate::dequant`] ([`crate::dequant::MbDequantFactors`]).
//! * The §14.2 macroblock-level orchestration (Y2 → 16 Y DC seeding,
//!   the 24/25-block walk) — that is the integration round's job; this
//!   module provides only the per-block primitives.
//!
//! # Resolved spec references
//!
//! * **§14.1 page 77 Y2 / chroma dequant scaling.** §14.1 page 77 says
//!   the Y2 and chroma factors *"undergo either scaling or clamping
//!   before the multiplies. Details ... can be found in related lookup
//!   functions in dixie.c (Section 20.4)."* Section 20.4 is part of RFC
//!   6386 (the reference-decoder annex), so the scaling / clamping rules
//!   it gives are in-spec; they are implemented in [`crate::dequant`].
//! * **§13 page 60 zig-zag scan order.** The 16-entry scan-to-raster
//!   permutation is given by the §20.16 `zigzag[16]` table (also part of
//!   RFC 6386); the per-MB token walk applies it (see
//!   [`crate::dct_tokens`]).
