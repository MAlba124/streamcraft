//! VP8 §14 forward 4×4 DCT and WHT primitives (encoder side).
//!
//! The RFC 6386 §14.3 / §14.4 listings give the **inverse** transforms
//! `vp8_short_inv_walsh4x4_c` and `short_idct4x4llm_c`. The forward
//! transforms are not listed in the spec — but they are mechanically
//! recoverable as the transpose of the inverse (the §14.4 preamble
//! itself notes the transform is *"a classical 2-D inverse discrete
//! cosine transform, implemented as two passes of 1-D inverse DCT"*).
//! The primitives below were derived in this crate, from the §14.3 /
//! §14.4 inverses listed in RFC 6386, with no reference to any
//! external forward-transform implementation.
//!
//! # Derivation summary
//!
//! Write the §14.3 inverse WHT as a 2-D matrix product on a 4×4 block:
//!
//! ```text
//! IWHT(c) = round((M * c * M^T) / 8)
//! ```
//!
//! where the §14.3 column-pass / row-pass arithmetic
//! (`a1 = i0+i12`, `b1 = i4+i8`, `c1 = i4-i8`, `d1 = i0-i12`,
//! `op[0]=a1+b1`, `op[4]=c1+d1`, `op[8]=a1-b1`, `op[12]=d1-c1`)
//! unfolds to a Walsh-Hadamard matrix
//!
//! ```text
//! M = [[1,  1,  1,  1],
//!      [1,  1, -1, -1],
//!      [1, -1, -1,  1],
//!      [1, -1,  1, -1]]
//! ```
//!
//! that satisfies `M * M^T = 4 * I` and is symmetric (`M = M^T`). The
//! `(x + 3) >> 3` rounding in the second pass divides the result by 8.
//!
//! The forward WHT is therefore
//!
//! ```text
//! FWHT(p) = round((M * p * M) / 2)
//! ```
//!
//! (since `IWHT(FWHT(p)) = round( ((M * (M*p*M) * M^T) / 2) / 8 )
//!                       = round((M*M)*p*(M*M^T) / 16)
//!                       = round(4 * I * p * 4 * I / 16) = p`).
//!
//! For the §14.4 inverse DCT, the column-pass arithmetic
//!
//! ```text
//! a1 = i0 + i8;   b1 = i0 - i8
//! c1 = (i4*S)>>16 - (i12 + (i12*C')>>16)        // S, C'+1 = sqrt(2)*sin(pi/8), sqrt(2)*cos(pi/8)
//! d1 = (i4 + (i4*C')>>16) + (i12*S)>>16
//! op[0]  = a1 + d1
//! op[4]  = b1 + c1
//! op[8]  = b1 - c1
//! op[12] = a1 - d1
//! ```
//!
//! is the linear map
//!
//! ```text
//! T_inv = [[1,  C,  1,  S],
//!          [1,  S, -1, -C],
//!          [1, -S, -1,  C],
//!          [1, -C,  1, -S]]
//! ```
//!
//! with `C = sqrt(2)*cos(pi/8)` and `S = sqrt(2)*sin(pi/8)` so that
//! `C^2 + S^2 = 2` (and therefore `T_inv * T_inv^T = 4 * I`). The
//! second-pass `(x + 4) >> 3` divides by 8. By the same algebra as the
//! WHT, the forward 1-D DCT is the transpose of `T_inv`,
//!
//! ```text
//! T_fwd = T_inv^T = [[1,  1,  1,  1],
//!                    [C,  S, -S, -C],
//!                    [1, -1, -1,  1],
//!                    [S, -C,  C, -S]]
//! ```
//!
//! and the 2-D forward DCT is
//!
//! ```text
//! FDCT(p) = round((T_fwd * p * T_fwd^T) / 2)
//! ```
//!
//! The 16-bit fixed-point evaluation reuses the same two §14.4
//! constants `COSPI8_SQRT2_MINUS1 = 20091` (`(C - 1) << 16`) and
//! `SINPI8_SQRT2 = 35468` (`S << 16`) — `i * C = i + ((i * 20091) >> 16)`
//! and `i * S = (i * 35468) >> 16` — so the forward path's
//! finite-precision rounding tracks the §14.4 inverse path's.
//!
