//! Encoder-side §14.1 dequant correctness regression: the inter MB
//! picker must dequantise its forward-transform output before handing
//! it to the reconstruction orchestrators.
//!
//! RFC 6386 §14.1 (pages 78-80): "the coefficients output by the
//! forward DCT/WHT are quantised by integer division against the
//! per-block §14.1 step tables; the reverse path (the path the decoder
//! walks, and the path the encoder's own reconstruction must walk to
//! stay in lock-step) multiplies by the same step before the inverse
//! transform." The `motion_comp::reconstruct_inter_mb` and
//! `reconstruct_split_mv_mb` orchestrators document this on their
//! parameter names (`*_coeffs_dequant`) and the keyframe encoder path
//! already performs the dequant step on a copy of `MbCoeffs` before
//! calling its keyframe-mode reconstructor.
//!
//! Prior to the fix exercised here, the inter MB picker handed the
//! still-quantised forward-transform output straight into the inter
//! reconstructor, so the encoder's stored reconstruction was off by
//! the §14.1 dequant factor on every coded sub-block. The decoder
//! self-decode walked the spec-correct path and recovered the
//! quantised-then-dequantised pixels, leaving a mismatch between the
//! encoder's `_p_reconstruction` and the decoder's `Vp8DecodedFrame`
//! on the same wire.
//!
//! The two tests below pin that the encoder reconstruction matches
//! the decoder self-decode at two §15 loop-filter operating points:
//!
//!   * `loop_filter_level = 0` — §15 is gated off in both directions,
//!     so any residual mismatch is purely the §14.2 / §14.5 inverse
//!     transform + clamp path and isolates the §14.1 dequant defect
//!     this fix targets.
//!   * `loop_filter_level = 32` — §15 runs on both sides; the encoder
//!     applies its own post-walk filter pass and the decoder's §15
//!     pass runs over the same wire. With the dequant fix in place
//!     both ends feed §15 the same pre-filter pixels, so the post-§15
//!     reconstructions agree as well.
