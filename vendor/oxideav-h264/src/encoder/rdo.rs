//! Lagrangian rate-distortion optimisation (RDO) helpers — round 15.
//!
//! The round-1..4 mode-decision metric was SAD on the predictor — fast
//! but wrong: it ignores the residual's bit-cost AND the quantisation
//! noise on the reconstructed samples. With AC residual transmit (round
//! 3) and per-block I_NxN modes (round 4) those omissions are no longer
//! cheap: I_NxN under-quotes its rate (16 prev/rem flags + 16 CAVLC
//! blocks of mostly zero coefficients) and I_16x16 under-quotes its
//! reconstructed quality (the AC residual it transmits actually closes
//! most of the SAD-on-predictor gap).
//!
//! Real H.264 reference encoders pick the (mode, sub-mode) tuple that
//! minimises **`J = D + λ · R`** where `D` is the per-block sum of
//! squared differences (SSD) between source and reconstruction, `R` is
//! the actual number of bits the syntax + CAVLC writer would emit for
//! this candidate, and `λ` is the Lagrange multiplier.
//!
//! ## λ derivation
//!
//! H.264 / AVC class encoders converge to `λ ≈ 0.85 · 2^((QP - 12) / 3)`
//! for SSD-domain mode decision. This crate uses the same closed form.
//! The 0.85 prefactor biases very slightly toward higher quality at
//! low-to-mid QP; the 2^((QP-12)/3) factor matches the AVC quantisation
//! step doubling every six QP increments.
//!
//! For RDO on Intra macroblocks, a common refinement multiplies λ by
//! 0.5 on the mode-decision step (intra modes are slightly under-rated
//! by direct SSD/bit accounting due to the chroma residual that
//! piggybacks). This crate adopts that approach.
//!
//! All spec / convention references in comments cite ITU-T Rec. H.264
//! (08/2024). No external implementation source consulted.
