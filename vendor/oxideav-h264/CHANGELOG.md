### Fixed

- **Round-385 — decoder CAVLC 4:4:4 8x8 read-path.** At
  ChromaArrayType == 3 with `transform_size_8x8_flag = 1` the Cb/Cr
  plane residuals are now §7.4.5.3.3-interleaved at parse time
  (mirroring the round-382 luma fix); previously the raw de-interleaved
  4x4 lists were stored while the 4:4:4 8x8 reconstruction consumed
  contiguous 8x8-scan chunks, scrambling every CAVLC 4:4:4
  8x8-transform chroma residual.

### Added

- **Round-385 — 8x8 transform under CABAC (blockCat-5), I / P / B.**
  `encode_idr_cabac` runs a per-MB I_16x16-vs-Intra_8x8 trial: a winner
  codes mb_type I_NxN + the §9.3.3.1.1.10 `transform_size_8x8_flag`
  (new `encode_transform_size_8x8_flag`, ctxIdxOffset 399 with per-MB
  neighbour condTerm tracking), four prev/rem Intra_8x8 pred-mode
  pairs, an explicit CBP, and one §7.3.5.3.3 blockCat-5 64-coefficient
  residual per coded quadrant (CBF suppressed at 4:2:0 and folded into
  the four 4x4 slots — decoder mirror; Table 9-43 significance maps
  pinned by new 64-coefficient roundtrip unit tests).
  `encode_p_cabac` / `encode_b_cabac` run the shared §8.6.4 8x8-vs-4x4
  luma-residual trial on every coded MB and code the §7.3.5 second-gate
  flag after CBP whenever `cbp_luma > 0` (all emitted P/B shapes
  qualify; skips stay gate-exempt; the flag normalises to the
  decoder-inferred 0 when cbp collapses). `i8x8_mb_count` now counts
  CABAC picks on IDR / P / B. Gated by
  `tests/integration_i8x8_cabac.rs`: 6 tests, all bit-exact through
  both our decoder and the black-box reference decoder.
- **Round-385 — 4:2:2 Intra_8x8 encode.** The 3-way transform-size RDO
  runs at High 4:2:2 (profile 122): new `write_i8x8_mb_chroma` writer
  takes `ChromaWriteKind` (4:2:0 delegates bit-identically), and the
  4:2:2 I_NxN writer gains the mandatory §7.3.5
  `transform_size_8x8_flag = 0` emission inside a
  `transform_8x8_mode_flag = 1` stream. Bit-exact self-roundtrip +
  yuv422p black-box interop tests.
- **Round-385 — 4:4:4 Intra_8x8 encode (§8.3.4.5 chroma coded like
  luma).** With `transform_8x8` at chroma_format_idc = 3 every MB codes
  Intra_8x8: Cb/Cr predict each quadrant with the chosen luma mode, run
  the 8x8 transform at the chroma QP, and emit the §7.4.5.3.3 split
  under the shared CBP (Table 9-4(b) inverse via
  `intra_cbp_to_codenum_0_3`; real per-plane §9.2.1.1 nC via the new
  `derive_nc_plane_luma_like`). Bit-exact self-roundtrip + yuv444p
  black-box interop.
- **B-MB 8x8-residual RDO — the 8x8 transform now wins on B slices
  too.** The `encode_b` per-MB path runs the same §8.6.4
  8x8-vs-sixteen-4x4 luma-residual trial as `encode_p`
  (`forward_inter_luma_8x8` + `inter_luma_transform_cost`, lower
  `J = D + λ·R` wins) for every coded B shape; the six B CAVLC writers'
  flag field is upgraded from emit-0-only to
  `transform_size_8x8_flag: Option<bool>` so a winning trial codes the
  §7.3.5 second-gate flag as 1 with the §7.4.5.3.3 de-interleaved
  residual split, and the §8.7 deblock mirror carries the per-MB flag.
  New `EncodedB::i8x8_mb_count` (CABAC paths report 0). The IDR+P+B GOP
  gate now also asserts the B-slice RDO genuinely selects 8x8 (3/16 B
  MBs on the fixture) while both decoders stay bit-exact.
- **B-slice second-gate `transform_size_8x8_flag` coding — full
  IDR+P+B GOPs under `transform_8x8`.** Every coded B MB shape this
  encoder emits (B_L0/L1/Bi_16x16, B_Direct_16x16, 16x8 / 8x16
  partitions, all-Direct and mixed B_8x8) passes the §7.3.5 second gate
  in a `transform_8x8_mode_flag = 1` stream (no sub-partition below
  8x8; `direct_8x8_inference_flag = 1` in our SPS), so all six B CAVLC
  writers now code the mandatory flag as 0 when `cbp_luma > 0` (new
  `emit_transform_size_8x8_zero` on each B config struct); the B
  residual itself stays on the 4x4 transform (an 8x8-residual RDO trial
  for B MBs is a follow-up). The `encode_b` transform_8x8 rejection is
  lifted. Gated by `i8x8_b_slice_gop_codes_second_gate_flag_and_
  roundtrips`: a 3-frame IDR+P+B GOP (with a vacuity guard proving the
  B slice genuinely codes MBs) decodes bit-exactly through both our
  decoder and the black-box reference decoder.
- **P-slice inter 8x8 transform (`transform_size_8x8_flag` on
  P_L0_16x16).** With `transform_8x8` set, `encode_p`'s coded-MB path
  trials the §8.6.4 forward 8x8 transform of the motion-compensated
  luma residual (one transform per quadrant, inter quantiser rounding)
  against the sixteen-4x4 coding and keeps the lower `J = D + λ·R`
  alternative (`forward_inter_luma_8x8` + `inter_luma_transform_cost`).
  The §7.3.5 second-gate flag is coded after `coded_block_pattern` when
  `cbp_luma > 0` (`PL016x16McbConfig::transform_size_8x8_flag`); the
  4MV all-PL08x8 writer codes the mandatory flag as 0
  (`P8x8AllPL08x8McbConfig::emit_transform_size_8x8_zero` — its
  sub-partitions are 8x8 so `noSubMbPartSizeLessThan8x8Flag = 1`);
  P_Skip and the Intra_16x16 fallback are gate-exempt per §7.3.5.
  `EncodedP::i8x8_mb_count` mirrors the IDR counter. `encode_b` rejects
  `transform_8x8` until the B-slice writers grow the flag. Gated by
  `i8x8_p_slice_inter_8x8_transform_roundtrips_bit_exact`: a
  low-frequency ramp residual makes the RDO pick 8x8 on P MBs and the
  2-frame stream decodes bit-exactly through both our decoder and the
  black-box reference decoder.
- **Adaptive per-MB transform-size RDO (I_16x16 / I_4x4 / I_8x8).**
  With `EncoderConfig::transform_8x8` set, `encode_idr`'s per-MB
  Lagrangian RDO now runs a third **Intra_8x8** trial alongside the
  existing I_16x16 and I_4x4 trials (same snapshot/rollback
  discipline), installing the lowest-J winner per macroblock instead of
  forcing every MB to 8x8. Mixed streams are spec-correct: I_4x4 MBs
  code `transform_size_8x8_flag = 0` per §7.3.5 (the flag is mandatory
  for I_NxN once the PPS signals `transform_8x8_mode_flag = 1`) via the
  new `INxNMcbConfig::emit_transform_size_8x8_zero`. New
  `EncodedIdr::i8x8_mb_count` surfaces how many MBs the RDO coded as
  Intra_8x8. On the mixed gradient+texture fixture the RDO picks
  Intra_8x8 for 4/16 MBs (the textured quadrant) and the stream stays
  bit-exact through both our decoder and the black-box reference
  decoder (`i8x8_adaptive_rdo_selects_8x8_on_textured_content_and_
  roundtrips`, + a zero-count guard for non-8x8 configs).
- **High-profile Intra_8x8 (8x8-transform) IDR encoder — bit-exact
  through both our decoder and a black-box reference decoder.** New
  `EncoderConfig::transform_8x8` drives `encode_idr` to code every MB
  as I_NxN + `transform_size_8x8_flag = 1` (§7.3.5): per-8x8-block
  §8.3.2 intra prediction (all 9 modes, availability-gated per
  §8.3.2.2.2..2.10, Lagrangian RDO), the §8.3.2.1 eq. 8-73
  `predIntra8x8PredMode` derivation mirrored encoder-side (including
  the eq. 8-72 Intra_4x4-neighbour sub-index), §8.6.4 forward 8x8
  transform + §8.5.13.1 quantiser, Table 8-14 8x8 zig-zag, and the
  §7.4.5.3.3 four-4x4 CAVLC split with the §9.2.1.1 per-sub-block nC
  walk. The SPS auto-promotes to High (`profile_idc = 100`, §A.2.4) and
  the PPS emits the §7.3.2.2 optional tail (`transform_8x8_mode_flag =
  1`, flat scaling, `second_chroma_qp_index_offset`). The §8.7 deblock
  runs with the 8x8-transform internal-edge skip mirrored through a new
  `MbDeblockInfo::transform_size_8x8_flag`. Four integration tests
  (`integration_i8x8_encoder.rs`): High-profile SPS/PPS syntax,
  bit-exact self-roundtrip, bit-exact black-box reference-decoder
  interop, and a PSNR-Y sanity floor at QP 26 on a mixed
  gradient+texture fixture.

### Fixed

- **§7.4.5.3.3 CAVLC 8x8 luma residual de-interleave (decoder).** The
  CAVLC path for `transform_size_8x8_flag = 1` macroblocks read the
  four per-quadrant 4x4 residual blocks but stored them *concatenated*
  instead of applying the normative interleave `level8x8[4·i + i4x4] =
  level4x4[i4x4][i]`, so every CAVLC 8x8-transform macroblock
  reconstructed from a scrambled coefficient order (a long-standing
  documented simplification — the CABAC path was unaffected). The
  macroblock-layer parser now interleaves the four scan lists into the
  8x8 scan order before storage, making the CAVLC and CABAC storage
  conventions identical for the §8.5.13 inverse-transform consumer.
  Locked by the round-382 bit-exact encoder round-trip gates.

### Added

- **§8.6.4 / §8.5.13 High-profile 8x8 forward transform + quantizer
  (encoder side).** New `encoder::transform::forward_core_8x8`
  (`W = E8 · X · E8ᵀ` with the integer 8x8 basis `E8`, the transpose of
  the normative §8.5.13.2 inverse butterfly), `quantize_8x8`
  (`MF8x8[m][class] = round(2^18 / normAdjust8x8)` with
  `qBits8 = 22 + qP/6`), `zigzag_scan_8x8` (Table 8-14 frame scan,
  inverse of the decoder's `inverse_scan_8x8_zigzag`), and
  `deinterleave_8x8_to_4x4` (§7.4.5.3.3 `level4x4[i4x4][i] =
  level8x8[4·i + i4x4]` for the CAVLC four-4x4 residual split). Round-trip
  quality is gated against the decoder's normative `inverse_transform_8x8`:
  a smooth ramp + mid-frequency ripple recovers to within `4·2^(qP/6)+2`
  per sample across QP 16/22/26/30; the `E8` basis is verified orthogonal
  and the 8x8 zig-zag verified an exact inverse of the decoder scan. This
  is the transform foundation for the High-profile Intra_8x8 encode path.
- **§7.4.1.2.4 `bottom_field_flag` primary-coded-picture boundary.** The
  first-VCL-of-new-picture detection now treats a change in
  `bottom_field_flag` (when both slices are field pictures) as a picture
  boundary, so the top field of a complementary pair finalizes before
  the bottom field opens — the canonical condition that previously
  relied only on the incidental `pic_order_cnt_lsb` difference between
  the two fields. Gated off for frame pictures (`field_pic_flag == 0`),
  where `bottom_field_flag` is inferred 0 and irrelevant. Two unit tests
  cover the field-pair split and the frame-picture no-op.
- **PAFF (`field_pic_flag == 1`) field-picture decode + §C.4.4
  complementary-field pairing.** A picture-adaptive frame/field stream's
  individual field pictures now decode: a field is reconstructed as a
  half-height picture per §7.4.2.1.1 eq. (7-26)
  `PicHeightInMbs = FrameHeightInMbs / (1 + field_pic_flag)`, with the
  §7.3.4 macroblock walk, CAVLC/CABAC neighbour grids and §8 sample
  placement all operating in field-local coordinates (within a single
  field MbaffFrameFlag == 0, so the §6.4 raster neighbour derivation
  applies unchanged). The decoder driver sizes the in-progress
  `Picture` + `MbGrid` to the coded field height, derives the field's
  own Top/BottomFieldOrderCnt for output ordering, and holds the first
  field of a complementary pair until its opposite-parity partner
  (same `frame_num`) arrives — at which point `interleave_fields`
  re-weaves the two half-height fields into one full-height output frame
  (top field → even rows, bottom field → odd rows) whose POC is
  `Min(TopFieldOrderCnt, BottomFieldOrderCnt)` (§8.2.1 eq. 8-1). A
  trailing unpaired field at IDR / MMCO-5 / EOF is emitted as a
  standalone half-height frame rather than dropped. New SPS geometry
  helpers `pic_height_in_mbs(field_pic_flag)` / `pic_size_in_mbs(...)`
  carry eq. (7-26)/(7-27); the previous blanket
  `field_pic_flag == 1` reconstruction rejection is removed. Six new
  unit tests cover the field geometry, the row-interleave parity
  placement, complementary-pair frame assembly, and the
  non-complementary orphan-flush path. (Byte-exact conformance against a
  black-box reference is blocked: neither x264 nor the in-tree encoder
  emits PAFF field-coded streams — x264's interlaced mode is MBAFF only
  — so no field-picture fixture is available; see followups.)
- **Conformance gates for 4:2:2 (ChromaArrayType == 2) P / B-slice inter
  chroma reconstruction.** The §8.4.1.4 chroma-MV derivation (eq.
  8-221/8-222: `mvCLX = mvLX`, SubHeightC == 1 so no vertical halving),
  the §8.4.2.2 fractional-position rule (eq. 8-231..8-234: `yIntC +=
  mvCLX[1] >> 2`, `yFracC = (mvCLX[1] & 3) << 1` for the full-height
  chroma grid; `xIntC` / `xFracC` shared with 4:2:0), the §8.4.2.3
  default / explicit / implicit weighted combine, and the §8.5 eight-4x4
  inter chroma residual all already ran for 4:2:2 P / B slices but were
  untested at the reconstruction level. Four new `reconstruct::tests`
  lock them with bit-exact assertions: `mc_chroma_422_vertical_quarter_
  pel_uses_subheightc_1` (the 4:2:2-distinguishing vertical 1/4-pel rule
  via a step-8 ramp), `mc_chroma_422_horizontal_quarter_pel_matches_420_
  x_rule`, `p_l0_16x16_422_zero_mv_copies_full_height_chroma` (end-to-end
  P_L0_16x16 over the 8x16 chroma tile), and
  `b_bi_16x16_422_default_averages_full_height_chroma` (end-to-end
  B_Bi_16x16 default averaging across all 16 chroma rows). The README's
  stale "P / B-slice 4:2:2 deferred" claim is corrected: only the 4:2:2
  *encoder* P / B path remains deferred.
- **Conformance gate for 4:4:4 (ChromaArrayType == 3) B-slice inter
  chroma reconstruction.** The 4:4:4 chroma planes are motion-compensated
  by the §8.4.2.2.1 luma 6-tap kernel (eq. 8-235..8-238) and combined by
  the §8.4.2.3 weighted-sample dispatch; the P path was already tested
  (`p_l0_16x16_444_*`) but the B-slice bipred combine was not.
  `b_bi_16x16_444_default_averages_full_resolution_chroma` locks the
  default-averaging combine across the full 16×16 4:4:4 chroma tile.
  Combined with the existing `intra_8x8_zero_residual_dc_reconstructs_
  444_chroma` (I_8x8 4:4:4 chroma) and the P-inter tests, the README's
  stale "I_8x8 4:4:4 / P / B 4:4:4 deferred" claim is corrected — only
  `separate_colour_plane_flag=1` remains deferred for 4:4:4.
- **Conformance gate for 4:2:2 explicit weighted prediction chroma.**
  `p_l0_16x16_422_explicit_weighted_per_plane_chroma` exercises the
  §8.4.2.3.2 (eq. 8-274) explicit weighted-pred combine on the 8×16 4:2:2
  chroma tile with distinct per-iCbCr (Cb/Cr) weights and offsets,
  asserting the per-plane weight selection and the full-height chroma
  walk are correct (Cb `((80·5 + 2) >> 2) + 1 == 101`, Cr `((80·3 + 2) >>
  2) + 7 == 67`).

### Fixed

- **§6.4.10 / Table 6-4 MBAFF intra neighbour addressing.** In an MBAFF
  frame (`mb_adaptive_frame_field_flag == 1 && !field_pic_flag`),
  macroblock addresses are pair-interleaved, so the §6.4.9 raster
  neighbour derivation (`mb_addr − 1`, `mb_addr − PicWidthInMbs`) used by
  the §8.3.1.1 / §8.3.2.1 intra-prediction-mode derivation pointed at the
  wrong neighbour macroblocks. The `intraMxMPredMode` predicted from
  those mis-located neighbours cascaded reconstruction errors across the
  whole picture (only MB 0, which has no neighbours, was correct).
  `neighbour_4x4_addr` / `neighbour_8x8_addr` now route through the
  §6.4.10 / Table 6-4 pair-aware derivation (via
  `mb_address::mbaff_neigh_location`) when the new `MbGrid.mbaff_frame_flag`
  is set, reading each macroblock's `mb_field_decoding_flag` (now recorded
  on `MbInfo`) for the `mbAddrXFrameFlag` input. On a synthetic 128×96
  MBAFF I-frame (libx264 `interlaced=1`) this lifts luma PSNR vs a
  black-box ffmpeg decode from ~9 dB to ~54 dB.

### Added

- round 355 — **§8.2.4.3 field reference-list modification (RPLM).**
  `modify_ref_pic_list_field` applies `modification_of_pic_nums_idc`
  ops to the `RefFieldEntry` lists from the field init step. Short-term
  ops (idc 0/1) derive `picNumLX` via eq. 8-34..8-36 with the field
  forms of CurrPicNum (`2*frame_num+1`) and MaxPicNum (`2*MaxFrameNum`),
  then splice the *field* of the DPB whose field-level PicNum
  (eq. 8-30/8-31, parity-relative to the current field) matches; the
  long-term op (idc 2) matches a field by field-level LongTermPicNum
  (eq. 8-32/8-33). The eq. 8-37/8-38 shift-and-compact splice is
  reduced to "drop the duplicate of the just-inserted field" since a
  field is uniquely keyed by `(dpb_key, parity)`. New
  `DpbEntry::field_pic_num` / `field_long_term_pic_num` give the
  per-parity numbers (the existing `pic_num` infers parity from the
  entry's own structure, which is wrong when a stored *frame* can
  supply either of its two fields). 5 spec-derived unit tests
  (parity-relative PicNum, subtract reorder, long-term splice,
  picNumLXPred chaining across ops, pad/truncate).

- round 355 — **§8.2.4.2.2 / §8.2.4.2.4 / §8.2.4.2.5 field reference
  picture list initialisation.** When the current picture is a coded
  field, each *field* of a stored reference frame is a separate
  reference picture with its own list index (§8.2.4.2.4), so the field
  RefPicLists are built in two stages: an ordered list of reference
  *frames* (§8.2.4.2.2 for P/SP — descending `FrameNumWrap` short-term,
  ascending `LongTermFrameIdx` long-term; §8.2.4.2.4 for B — the
  `PicOrderCnt`-partitioned List0/List1 frame orders), then the
  §8.2.4.2.5 parity-alternation interleave that emits one entry per
  field, starting with the current field's own parity, skipping any
  frame whose field of the wanted parity was not decoded ("the missing
  field is ignored"), and appending the leftover fields of the available
  parity in frame order once the alternate parity is exhausted. New
  `FieldParity` / `RefFieldEntry` types name the `(dpb_key, parity)` of
  each list entry; `init_ref_pic_list_p_field`,
  `init_ref_pic_lists_b_field`, and the shared `interleave_fields` helper
  implement the three clauses, plus `DpbEntry::has_field` / `field_poc`
  accessors for per-parity availability + POC. Covered by 18
  spec-derived unit tests. This replaces the previous "fields treated as
  single-parity reference frames" placeholder for the list-interleaving
  step; the frame-only paths (`init_ref_pic_list_p` /
  `init_ref_pic_lists_b`) are unchanged.

### Fixed

- round 349 — **§8.5.8 eq. 8-309 QP_Y derivation for >8-bit luma.** The
  per-MB `QP_Y` modulo used the addend `52 + QpBdOffsetY` where the spec
  requires `52 + 2*QpBdOffsetY` (the modulus stays `52 + QpBdOffsetY`).
  For 8-bit luma `QpBdOffsetY == 0` so the two coincide (all 8-bit
  fixtures were unaffected), but at 10-bit (`QpBdOffsetY = 12`) every
  macroblock's `QP_Y` came out 12 too low, dragging `qP'Y = QP_Y +
  QpBdOffsetY` below its true value and collapsing the §8.5.12
  inverse-quant scale so reconstructed residuals were ~16× too small —
  10/12/14-bit pictures decoded to a near-flat mid-gray. Extracted the
  derivation into `reconstruct::next_qp_y` with the corrected formula and
  spec-value unit tests at 8/10/12-bit. On the `10-bit-high10` fixture
  this lifts the (gateable) right MB column's luma to ~93% byte-exact —
  its top rows now match the reference exactly — and the overall match
  from 5.6% to 46.9% (the rest is the fixture's concealed left MB column,
  see Other).

### Added

- round 349 — High10 (10-bit, `profile_idc=110`) decode-path milestone
  guard (`corpus_10_bit_high10_emits_full_range`). The 10-bit fixture's
  `expected.yuv` cannot gate bit-exactness (its entire left MB column is
  concealed with `0x80` fill — 50% of the reference bytes; see Other),
  so this guard asserts the spec-checkable invariants of the >8-bit path
  instead: the all-intra frame decodes at 32×32 packed as `yuv420p10le`
  (2-bytes/sample LE-u16, 3072 B); every emitted sample is a legal
  10-bit value (`0..=1023`); and the luma plane genuinely exercises the
  >8-bit range (≥¼ of samples exceed 255), proving the §8.5.12 dequant
  at `qP'=qP+QpBdOffsetY` (=qP+12), the `1<<(10-1)=512` predicted DC
  default, and the LE-u16 plane packing are all wired end-to-end rather
  than collapsed to 8-bit.

- round 346 — enforced bit-exact gate for the High 4:4:4 Predictive
  I_4x4 decode path (`integration_high444_i4x4_bitexact`). The
  `intra-only-high444` fixture's high-QP picture (frame 1) decodes
  byte-for-byte against its reference YUV, exercising §7.3.5.3 /
  §8.3.4.5 4:4:4 Intra_4x4 luma + the "chroma coded like luma" Cb/Cr
  reconstruction (per-block luma pred-mode reuse) at ChromaArrayType==3.
  This path could not be gated by the multi-frame `docs_corpus` case
  because that fixture's frame 0 reference is defective (see below).

### Other

- round 346 — corpus fixture diagnosis. Root-caused the remaining
  `ReportOnly` corpus divergences to defective/under-specified staged
  reference data, not decoder bugs (verified, no web tools, spec-only):
  (a) `4-4-4-high` and `intra-only-high444` frame 0 — `expected.yuv`
  luma is a uniform 128 despite the bitstream coding textured CABAC
  I_4x4 MBs (same defect class as `i-only-64x64-main`); our decoder
  produces correct texture, confirmed against the bit-exact
  `transform-8x8-on` 4:2:0 I_4x4 path. (b) `multi-ref-frames` —
  `expected.yuv` holds 2 non-consecutive frames (IDR + the 5th coded
  picture, `frame_num=4`) while the harness scores them as the first 2
  decoded frames; the 94% is an artefact of the 5th picture being a
  near-copy of the IDR. (c) `bipred-with-b-frames-main` — `expected.yuv`
  frame 1's bottom MB row diverges from its own frame 0 by up to +16
  despite the trace recording `mv=(0,0)`, no luma residual, identity
  weights, and bS=0 internal edges — a delta the spec cannot produce, so
  the reference is internally inconsistent. All recorded as docs-gaps for
  fixture regeneration; the affected cases stay `ReportOnly`.

- round 349 — `10-bit-high10` corpus fixture diagnosis (spec-only, no
  web tools). The fixture's `expected.yuv` is partially concealed: the
  whole left MB column (luma x∈0..16 over both MB rows, plus co-sited
  chroma) is `0x80` byte-fill — exactly 50% (1536/3072) of the reference
  bytes are the FFmpeg-HEAD conceal-MB mid-gray seen in
  `i-only-64x64-main` (100%) / `4-4-4-high` (52%) / `intra-only-high444`
  (29%), and `0x8080` as LE-u16 (32896) is not even a legal 10-bit
  value. Per `trace.txt` all four MBs are real textured CABAC I_4x4
  (CBPs 0x27..0x2e), so a flat left column cannot be a true decode. The
  valid right MB column can't gate either, because its §8.3.1.2 intra-4x4
  prediction reads the concealed left-MB right edge as its left
  neighbour — so no part of this `expected.yuv` is verifiable 10-bit
  ground truth. Recorded as a docs-gap for fixture regeneration; the
  scoring case stays `ReportOnly`, with the verifiable 10-bit invariants
  now guarded by `corpus_10_bit_high10_emits_full_range` (see Added). A
  byte-exact gate on the High10 path is unblocked the moment the fixture
  is re-exported without the conceal-MB fill.

- round 343 — fixture-validation hardening. Ran the full staged
  `docs/video/h264/fixtures/` corpus byte-for-byte against each
  `expected.yuv` and promoted the ten fixtures that decode bit-exactly
  from `ReportOnly` to the enforced `BitExact` tier (test fails on any
  divergence): `tiny-i-only-16x16-baseline`,
  `i-frame-then-p-frame-baseline`, `cavlc-mode`, `cabac-mode`,
  `transform-8x8-on`, `qp-low-cqp`, `qp-high-cqp`,
  `weighted-prediction-explicit`, and `iso-mp4-vs-annexb` on both the
  Annex-B and length-prefixed-AVC (avcC) framing paths. These now guard
  against regression in the all-intra, CAVLC/CABAC entropy, §8.5
  transform + QP-extreme, §8.4.2.3.2 explicit-weighted, and container
  framing decode paths. Diagnosed and documented (in each fixture's test
  comment) the remaining gaps: two fixtures carry bogus reference YUV
  (`i-only-64x64-main` — `expected.yuv` is a uniform 128 that cannot
  correspond to its non-zero-CBP 16-MB CABAC I-frame; `multi-slice-per-frame`
  — a single-coded-picture bitstream split into two reference frames),
  and a genuine narrow §8.4.2 inter edge-case affecting only the bottom
  MB row of P_L0 pictures (`bipred-with-b-frames-main` 90.4 %,
  `multi-ref-frames` 94.3 %; Y max diff ≤16, chroma ≤10, survives with
  deblocking disabled). No `src/` behaviour change; the corpus harness is
  the deliverable.
- round 339 — MBAFF (macroblock-adaptive frame/field) decode. Added the
  exact §6.4.12.2 Table 6-4 neighbouring-location derivation
  (`mb_address::mbaff_neigh_location`) covering all six spatial cells and
  the full (currMbFrameFlag, mbIsTopMbFlag, mbAddrXFrameFlag, yN-parity)
  dispatch, returning `(mbAddrN, xW, yW)` per eqs. 6-36/6-37. Wired the
  §6.4.11.1 MB-level neighbour addresses (Table 6-2 (xN,yN) = (-1,0)/(0,-1))
  into the CABAC `mb_skip_flag` + per-MB `NeighbourCtx` context modeling
  and the §9.3.3.1.1.9 `coded_block_flag` external-MB lookup
  (`CabacNeighbourGrid::neighbour_mb_addrs_mbaff` / `new_mbaff`).
  Corrected the §7.3.5.1/.2 ref_idx-presence override to
  `mbaff_frame_flag && mb_field_decoding_flag` (field_pic_flag == 0 in an
  MBAFF frame) instead of unconditionally-true. Result: the libx264 Main
  MBAFF `mbaff-interlaced` fixture now parses both slices without CABAC
  desync (was: read-past-end at MB #21 of slice 0) and reconstructs both
  frames through the §6.4.1 field/frame y-stride path. New
  `corpus_mbaff_interlaced_parses` regression guard. 10 Table-6-4 unit
  tests. Deferred: field/frame-mixed-pair §6.4.11.4 block-index
  remapping, §8.7.2 MBAFF deblock cascade, PAFF (`field_pic_flag == 1`).
- round 334 — §G.13.1.7 `view_dependency_change()` SEI message (payload
  type 42, Annex G / MVC). Parses `seq_parameter_set_id` (range-checked
  0..=31 per §G.13.2.7), `anchor_update_flag` / `non_anchor_update_flag`,
  and — when an update flag is set — the per-view
  `anchor_ref_lX_flag[i][j]` / `non_anchor_ref_lX_flag[i][j]` arrays for
  view indices `i ∈ 1..=num_views_minus1`. The §G.13.1.7 inner-loop
  bounds (`num_views_minus1`, `num_anchor_refs_lX[i]`,
  `num_non_anchor_refs_lX[i]`) are not in the payload — §G.13.2.7 takes
  them from the active MVC subset SPS (§G.7.3.2.1.4), so they are supplied
  through the new `SeiContext::mvc_view_ref_counts` field (a
  `Vec<MvcViewRefCounts>` indexed view-1-first). The anchor and
  non-anchor blocks are decoded as two SEPARATE per-view loops per the
  spec (not interleaved). When an update flag is set but the context
  carries no MVC counts the message is rejected with
  `SeiError::ViewDependencyChangeRefCountsUnknown`, mirroring the
  §H.13.1.5 depth_timing / §D.1.10 spare_pic context-gating precedent.
  Six unit tests (no-update, anchor-only, both-updates separate-loop
  ordering, unknown-context rejection, sps-id range rejection, dispatch)
  plus the malformed-input sweep (type 42 added; cardinality 3168 →
  3212) and the `sei_payload` cargo-fuzz context generator. `SeiContext`
  drops its `Copy` derive (now `Clone` only) to carry the new
  variable-length field. Brings the SEI dispatch to 53 explicit payload
  types.
- round 330 — §H.7.3.2.1.4 `seq_parameter_set_mvcd_extension()` for the
  Annex H MVCD profiles 138 (Multiview Depth High) / 135 (Multiview Depth
  Stereo). The subset-SPS dispatch previously surfaced these as a typed
  `MvcdNotParsed` placeholder with the base SPS still read; it now parses
  the full MVCD extension into `SpsMvcdExtension`: the per-VOIdx view-info
  loop (`view_id[i]` + `depth_view_present_flag[i]` /
  `texture_view_present_flag[i]`, with a `num_depth_views()` accessor for
  the §H.7.4.2.1.4 `NumDepthViews` count), the `depth_view_present_flag`-
  gated anchor + non-anchor inter-view reference loops (reusing the §G MVC
  `Min(15, num_views_minus1)` count cap + 0..=1023 view-id bounds by
  reference from §H.7.4.2.1.4), and the per-level operation points
  (`MvcdApplicableOp` / `MvcdLevelValue`) extended with per-target-view
  `applicable_op_depth_flag` / `applicable_op_texture_flag` and the
  `applicable_op_num_texture_views_minus1` / `applicable_op_num_depth_views`
  counts. The §H.7.3.2.1.4 tail flags `mvcd_vui_parameters_present_flag`
  (parsing the new §H.14.1 `mvcd_vui_parameters_extension()` into
  `MvcdVuiParametersExtension`, with per-op depth/texture target-view flags
  and §E timing/HRD reuse) and `texture_vui_parameters_present_flag`
  (reusing the §G.14.1 `mvc_vui_parameters_extension()` parser) are now
  read, so profiles 138/135 reach `additional_extension2_flag` and finish
  the RBSP. The `SubsetSpsExtension::MvcdNotParsed` variant is replaced by
  a fully-parsed `Mvcd { extension, vui, texture_vui }` variant; profile
  139 (MVCD + Annex I 3D-AVC) stays `Mvcd3dNotParsed` because the trailing
  `seq_parameter_set_3davc_extension()` is unimplemented. Five new range-
  bound error variants (`OpNumTextureViewsOutOfRange`,
  `OpNumDepthViewsOutOfRange`, `VuiMvcdNumOpsOutOfRange`,
  `VuiMvcdNumTargetOutputViewsOutOfRange`, `VuiMvcdViewIdOutOfRange`) plus
  five round-trip / gating / VUI / texture-VUI / rejection tests. Source:
  ITU-T Rec. H.264 (2024-08) §7.3.2.1.3, §H.7.3.2.1.4, §H.7.4.2.1.4,
  §H.14.1, §H.14.2.
- round 325 — §7.3.2.1.2 `seq_parameter_set_extension_rbsp()` (NAL unit
  type 13). The decoder previously routed type-13 NAL units to
  `Event::Ignored` with the body unread; it now parses the sequence
  parameter set extension into a new `SeqParameterSetExtension`
  (`src/sps_extension.rs`). The parser reads `seq_parameter_set_id`
  (range-checked 0..=31), `aux_format_idc` (range-checked 0..=3 per
  §7.4.2.1.2; reserved values >3 rejected), and — when
  `aux_format_idc != 0` — the auxiliary-coded-picture / alpha-blending
  block: `bit_depth_aux_minus8` (range-checked 0..=4), `alpha_incr_flag`,
  and the `bit_depth_aux_minus8 + 9`-bit `u(v)` `alpha_opaque_value` /
  `alpha_transparent_value` (the §7.4.2.1.2 width rule), exposed as
  `AuxFormat` with `bit_depth_aux()` / `alpha_value_bits()` helpers;
  finally `additional_extension_flag`. The body is stored keyed by the
  supplemented `seq_parameter_set_id` (the ordinary SPS id space, since an
  SPS extension supplements the SPS of the same id) and surfaced through a
  new `Event::SpsExtensionStored(id)` event plus a `Decoder::sps_extension`
  accessor. Auxiliary-picture reconstruction is not wired — §7.4.2.1.2
  states "the decoding of the sequence parameter set extension and the
  decoding of auxiliary coded pictures is not required for conformance" —
  but the parameters are now surfaced rather than discarded. Eight unit
  tests cover `aux_format_idc == 0` (no aux block), the full aux block,
  the `bit_depth_aux_minus8 == 0` 9-bit alpha-value width, the reserved
  `additional_extension_flag == 1`, the three range-check rejections, and a
  truncated-input EOF; one decoder test exercises NAL-13 dispatch +
  storage + the `sps_extension` accessor end-to-end.
- round 321 — Annex F (SVC) §F.7.3.2.1.4
  `seq_parameter_set_svc_extension()` + §F.14.1
  `svc_vui_parameters_extension()`. Subset SPSs with `profile_idc ∈
  {83, 86}` previously surfaced as `SubsetSpsExtension::SvcNotParsed`
  with the extension body unread; they now parse fully into a new
  `SubsetSpsExtension::Svc { extension, vui }` variant carrying
  `SpsSvcExtension` + optional `SvcVuiParametersExtension`. The SVC
  extension reads `inter_layer_deblocking_filter_control_present_flag`,
  `extended_spatial_scalability_idc` (range-checked 0..=2 per
  §F.7.4.2.1.4), the ChromaArrayType-gated `chroma_phase_x_plus1_flag`
  / `chroma_phase_y_plus1` (with the §F.7.4.2.1.4 absent-field
  inference to 1), the `extended_spatial_scalability_idc == 1`
  geometrical-resampling block (`seq_ref_layer_chroma_phase_*` gated on
  ChromaArrayType nonzero, four `se(v)` scaled-ref-layer offsets), and
  the `seq_tcoeff_level_prediction_flag` /
  `adaptive_tcoeff_level_prediction_flag` /
  `slice_header_restriction_flag` tail. The SVC VUI extension parses
  per-entry `vui_ext_dependency_id` / `vui_ext_quality_id` /
  `vui_ext_temporal_id`, reusing the §E.2.1 timing triple and §E.1.2
  NAL/VCL HRD parsers (mirroring the existing MVC VUI path).
  `vui_ext_num_entries_minus1` is range-checked (0..=1023) before
  allocation. Five new unit tests cover the basic round-trip (both SVC
  profiles), the ESS==1 geometrical block, the monochrome chroma-phase
  inference path, the two-entry SVC VUI with HRD, and the illegal
  `extended_spatial_scalability_idc == 3` rejection.
- round 318 — Annex H §H.13.1.6 / §H.13.2.6 alternative_depth_info SEI
  payload (type 181). The dispatch previously routed type 181 to
  `SeiPayload::Unknown`; it now parses the global-view-and-depth (GVD)
  camera-parameter body. `parse_alternative_depth_info` reads
  `depth_type` (ue(v)); a non-zero (reserved) type is recorded and the
  body ignored per the spec's "decoders shall ignore" rule. For
  `depth_type == 0` it parses `num_constituent_views_gvd_minus1`
  (0..=3 → `+2` cameras, base + constituent per Table H-4), the five
  GVD presence flags, the optional per-camera near/far depth pair
  (reusing the §H.13.2.3 `DepthFloatComponent`: sign u(1), exponent
  u(7) reserved-127, explicit `man_len_minus1+1` mantissa), and the
  optional per-camera intrinsic (focal lengths + principal point),
  3×3 rotation, and horizontal-translation float blocks (reusing the
  §G.13.2.5 `FloatComponent`: sign u(1), exponent u(6) reserved-63,
  prec-derived mantissa width via `mantissa_width_g1325`). Range
  checks enforce `num_constituent_views_gvd_minus1 ≤ 3` and each
  `prec_gvd_* ∈ 0..=31`. Six unit tests cover the all-flags-clear
  body, reserved-`depth_type` graceful ignore, the out-of-range
  guard, the z near/far block (denormal + normal + reserved-exponent
  `binToFp` eq. H-1 reconstruction), the intrinsic/rotation/
  translation block, and `parse_payload` dispatch; the type is added
  to the malformed-input never-panic sweep (cardinality 3124 → 3168)
  and the `sei_payload` fuzz target.
- round 314 — §8.4.2.2 ChromaArrayType==3 (4:4:4) inter chroma
  reconstruction. Previously the P/B inter path motion-compensated only
  luma at 4:4:4 and left the Cb/Cr planes zero (the chroma MC + residual
  branches handled only ChromaArrayType ∈ {1, 2}). Per §8.4.1.4 eq.
  8-221/8-222 the chroma motion vector equals the luma MV at 4:4:4
  (SubWidthC == SubHeightC == 1), and per §8.4.2.2 eq. 8-235..8-238 the
  chroma sample is taken at full-resolution integer position with
  quarter-sample fractions and the §8.4.2.2.1 *luma* 6-tap interpolation
  process (not the §8.4.2.2.2 chroma bilinear filter). New
  `mc_chroma_partition_444` runs the luma kernel on each chroma plane;
  the §8.4.2.3 default / explicit / implicit weighted-sample combine
  reuses the chroma weight tables / `chroma_log2_weight_denom`. The
  §8.5.5 "coded like luma" inter chroma residual is reconstructed by
  `reconstruct_inter_chroma_residual_444` (cbp_luma-gated 4x4 / 8x8
  blocks, inter chroma scaling lists Table 7-2 i=4/5 + i=9/11, no chroma
  DC Hadamard). Verified by a bit-identical MC equality test against the
  luma kernel plus two end-to-end P_L0_16x16 reconstructions (zero-MV
  plane copy + half-pel luma-6tap on chroma).

### Other

- round 306 — §8.7.2 eq. (8-450) 4:4:4 (ChromaArrayType == 3) chroma
  deblocking. Previously only the luma plane was deblocked at 4:4:4 and
  the Cb/Cr planes were left unfiltered (the `deblock_picture` chroma
  branch handled only ChromaArrayType ∈ {1, 2}). Per eq. (8-450)
  `chromaStyleFilteringFlag` evaluates to 0 for ChromaArrayType == 3, so
  the chroma planes are filtered with the *luma* filtering process (the
  four-sample p0..p2 / q0..q2 update), not the two-sample chroma-style
  filter. At 4:4:4 SubWidthC == SubHeightC == 1, so the chroma grid is
  full-resolution and shares the luma 16x16 MB edge geometry exactly: the
  new `deblock_plane_chroma_444` mirrors the luma walker (4 vertical + 4
  horizontal edges, identical `transform_size_8x8_flag` internal-edge
  skips) and derives `bS` from the same §8.7.2.1 per-4x4-block inputs (the
  §8.7.2.1 last paragraph maps the chroma sample at (x, y) onto the luma
  edge at (SubWidthC·x, SubHeightC·y) == (x, y)). The only per-edge
  difference is the quantization parameter: §8.7.2 uses QPC (§8.5.8, with
  the cb/cr `chroma_qp_index_offset`), and the QPC corresponding to
  QPY == 0 for an I_PCM macroblock. New helpers
  `filter_vertical_edge_plane_luma_style` /
  `filter_horizontal_edge_plane_luma_style` apply `filter_edge` with
  `Plane::Luma` to a selected chroma plane via `plane_at` / `plane_set`.
  Measured on the docs corpus: `intra-only-high444` frame 1 goes from
  76.14 % byte-exact (UV 1315/2048, max diff 20) to **100.00 %** (UV
  2048/2048, max diff 0), lifting the fixture aggregate from 60.97 % to
  72.90 %; the luma planes are unaffected. 2 new lib unit tests cover the
  luma-style filter firing at an intra MB edge and the bS == 0 skip.
- round 288 — Annex G (MVC) coded-slice-extension path: NAL unit type 20
  (`SliceExtension`) with `svc_extension_flag == 0` is now decoded as a
  §G.7.3.2.13 `slice_layer_extension_rbsp()` MVC body instead of falling
  through to `Event::Ignored`. Per §G.7.3.2.13 the MVC else-branch
  (neither `svc_extension_flag` nor `avc_3d_extension_flag` set) carries
  the *same* §7.3.3 `slice_header()` as a base-view slice, so the
  existing slice-header parser is reused with two MVC-specific
  adaptations: (a) `IdrPicFlag` is derived from the §G.7.3.1.1
  NAL-unit-header MVC extension's `non_idr_flag` (`IdrPicFlag =
  !non_idr_flag`, §G.7.4.1.1) rather than from the NAL unit type (fixed
  at 20); (b) the activated PPS's `seq_parameter_set_id` resolves against
  the **subset SPS** id space (NAL 15) rather than the ordinary SPS
  table, per the §G.7.4.1.2.1 activation rule ("a subset sequence
  parameter set RBSP … referred to by activation of a picture parameter
  set RBSP … activated by a coded slice MVC extension NAL unit"). The
  slice header is then parsed against the subset SPS's embedded base SPS.
  New `SliceHeader::parse_mvc_extension_and_tell` shares the parse body
  with `parse_and_tell` via a private `parse_and_tell_inner` taking the
  caller-resolved `idr_pic_flag`; the public `parse_and_tell` still
  rejects NAL 20/21 with `SliceExtensionNotSupported` so a base-view
  caller can't mis-parse an extension body. New `Event::SliceExtension`
  surfaces the parsed header alongside the §G.7.3.1.1 MVC fields
  (`view_id`, `temporal_id`, `anchor_pic_flag`, `inter_view_flag`), the
  derived `idr_pic_flag`, the activated PPS, the referencing subset SPS,
  and the slice_data() cursor. The §7.3.2.2 PPS-storage handler now
  resolves `chroma_format_idc` (needed for the scaling-matrix tail) from
  the subset SPS table when no ordinary SPS carries the referenced id,
  per §G.7.4.2.2 ("substituting MVC sequence parameter set for sequence
  parameter set"), so an MVC PPS that references a subset-SPS-only id is
  accepted. SVC bodies (`svc_extension_flag == 1`, Annex F) and 3D-AVC
  bodies (NAL 21, Annex J) still surface as `Event::Ignored` — their
  `slice_header_in_scalable_extension()` / `slice_header_in_3davc_extension()`
  prefixes are not modelled. New `DecoderError` variants:
  `UnknownSubsetSps(id)` (type-20 PPS references an unstored subset SPS)
  and `SliceExtensionBodyNotMvc`. 5 new decoder unit tests: two-view
  Stereo High (profile 128) MVC slice parsed against the subset SPS,
  IdrPicFlag derivation from `non_idr_flag` (non-IDR vs IDR-with-
  idr_pic_id bodies), missing-subset-SPS rejection, unknown-PPS
  rejection, and SVC-body fall-through to Ignored. Reconstruction of
  inter-view-predicted MVC slices remains out of scope (no §G.8
  inter-view reference assembly yet); this lands the parse + activation
  groundwork the r281 subset-SPS work flagged.

- round 281 — first Annex G (MVC) parameter-set body step: §7.3.2.1.3
  `subset_seq_parameter_set_rbsp()` (NAL unit type 15) parsing in a new
  `subset_sps` module, wired into the decoder. The embedded
  `seq_parameter_set_data()` body reuses the §7.3.2.1.1 SPS parser,
  extracted as `Sps::parse_seq_parameter_set_data` (cursor-based, no
  rbsp_trailing_bits) with `Sps::parse` now a thin wrapper. The
  per-profile extension branch dispatches on `profile_idc`:
  118 (Multiview High) / 128 (Stereo High) / 134 (MFC High) parse the
  full §G.7.3.2.1.4 `seq_parameter_set_mvc_extension()` — per-VOIdx
  `view_id[]` (0..=1023 each, `num_views_minus1 ≤ 1023` checked before
  allocation), the anchor + non-anchor inter-view dependency lists for
  both reference picture lists (per-list count capped at the
  §G.7.4.2.1.4 `Min(15, num_views_minus1)` bound; VOIdx 0 always empty
  per the `num_*_refs_lX[0] == 0` constraint, matching the syntax
  loops starting at i = 1), the signalled level values
  (`num_level_values_signalled_minus1 ≤ 63`) with their operation
  points (temporal_id u(3) + target view list + required-view count,
  all 0..=1023-bounded), and — for profile 134 only — the MFC tail:
  `mfc_format_idc` u(6) (Table G-1; reserved values 2..=63 stored, not
  rejected, per the §G.7.4.2.1.4 decoder-shall-ignore direction),
  `default_grid_position_flag` + explicit grid positions validated
  against the "shall be equal to 4, 8 or 12" constraint, a
  `grid_positions()` accessor applying the
  `default_grid_position_flag == 1` inference ((4, 8, 12, 8) for idc 0,
  (8, 4, 8, 12) for idc 1), `rpu_filter_enabled_flag`, and
  `rpu_field_processing_flag` (present only when
  `frame_mbs_only_flag == 0`; `rpu_field_processing()` applies the
  inferred-0 rule). The optional §G.14.1
  `mvc_vui_parameters_extension()` is parsed too: per-operation-point
  temporal_id, target output view list, timing info triple, NAL + VCL
  `hrd_parameters()` (reusing the §E.1.2 parser from `vui`),
  conditional `low_delay_hrd_flag`, and `pic_struct_present_flag`,
  with the §G.14.2 0..=1023 bounds enforced before every allocation.
  §7.4.2.1.3 semantics honoured: `bit_equal_to_one` must be 1
  (`SubsetSpsError::BitEqualToOneViolated`), and an
  `additional_extension2_flag == 1` reserved tail is consumed and
  discarded ("decoders shall ignore all data that follow"). SVC
  profiles 83/86 (Annex F), MVCD 138/135 (Annex H) and MVCD+3D-AVC 139
  (Annex H + I) extension bodies are not parsed yet — they surface as
  typed `SubsetSpsExtension::{Svc,Mvcd,Mvcd3d}NotParsed` variants with
  the base `seq_parameter_set_data()` still fully parsed, and
  `additional_extension2_flag` reported as `None` since the flag sits
  after the unparsed structure. Decoder integration: subset SPSs are
  stored in a `subset_sps_by_id` table separate from ordinary SPSs per
  the §7.4.1.2.1 separate-value-space rule, emitting a new
  `Event::SubsetSpsStored(id)` (NAL 15 no longer falls through to
  `Event::Ignored`), retrievable via `Decoder::subset_sps(id)`; new
  `DecoderError::SubsetSps` wraps the parse error. 16 new lib unit
  tests: two-view MVC round trip (view deps + level/op fields),
  minimal single-view Stereo High, MFC default-grid inference /
  explicit grid + field flag / reserved idc skips grid / invalid grid
  value rejection, bit_equal_to_one violation, `num_views_minus1 >
  1023` + `view_id > 1023` + anchor-ref-count-over-cap rejections, MVC
  VUI with timing + NAL HRD, SVC/MVCD/139 not-parsed variants, the
  no-extension-branch profile path, the reserved
  additional_extension2 tail, and an end-to-end `Decoder` check that
  the subset SPS lands in the separate table. Groundwork for the
  Annex G slice-extension path (NAL 20 activates subset SPSs) and the
  §H.7.3.2.1.5 MVCD extension that feeds
  `SeiContext::num_depth_views`.

- round 278 — fourth Annex H (3D-AVC) SEI payload: payload type 52
  `depth_timing` (§H.13.1.5 / §H.13.2.5), completing the contiguous
  Annex H/I payload block 50..=54 (depth_representation_info /
  three_dimensional_reference_displays_info / depth_timing /
  depth_sampling_info / constrained_depth_parameter_set_identifier).
  The message indicates the acquisition time of the depth view
  components of one or more access units relative to the DPB output
  time of the same access units; it pertains until the end of the
  coded video sequence or until the next depth timing SEI message,
  whichever is earlier in decoding order. `per_view_depth_timing_flag`
  (u(1)) selects either a single shared §H.13.1.5.1
  `depth_timing_offset()` (all depth view components in the target
  access unit set share one acquisition offset) or one offset per
  depth view in ascending view order index. The per-view loop bound is
  NOT in the payload — §H.13.1.5 loops over the SPS-derived
  `NumDepthViews` variable (accumulated from
  `depth_view_present_flag[i]` in the §H.7.3.2.1.5
  `seq_parameter_set_mvcd_extension()`), threaded through a new
  `SeiContext::num_depth_views` field. Default 0 (unknown / no Annex H
  subset SPS active) rejects the per-view branch with new
  `SeiError::DepthTimingNumDepthViewsUnknown`, mirroring the §D.1.10
  spare_pic treatment of an unknown `PicSizeInMapUnits`; values above
  1024 are rejected with `DepthTimingNumDepthViewsOutOfRange` since
  the §H.7.3.2.1.5 view loop runs `num_views_minus1 + 1 ≤ 1024` times
  and increments `NumDepthViews` at most once per iteration
  (pre-allocation gate in the round-177/200 anti-OOM spirit). New
  `DepthTimingOffset` struct carries `offset_len_minus1` (u(5)) +
  `depth_disp_delay_offset_fp` (u(offset_len_minus1 + 1), 1..=32
  bits per §H.13.2.5.1 "the length ... is equal to
  offset_len_minus1 + 1") + `depth_disp_delay_offset_dp` (u(6));
  `offset_clock_ticks()` reconstructs the §H.13.2.5.1 scalar
  `depth_disp_delay_offset_fp ÷ 2^depth_disp_delay_offset_dp` in
  units of clock ticks as specified in Annex C. Wired into
  `parse_payload`; the payload-type table at the top of `sei.rs`
  grows one row (§H.13.1.5). `tests/integration_sei_malformed.rs`
  `KNOWN_PAYLOAD_TYPES` grows from 49 → 50 entries (sweep cardinality
  3036 → 3080 panic-free invocations); two of the sweep contexts now
  carry non-zero `num_depth_views` (2 / 1024) so the per-view branch
  is part of the adversarial sweep, and the `sei_payload` fuzz
  context derives a bounded 0..=7 `num_depth_views` from its selector
  byte. 7 new lib unit tests cover the shared-offset path (1.0-tick
  round trip), the two-view path at the extreme fp widths (u(1) and
  u(32) with all bits set), the unknown-context rejection, the
  above-1024 rejection, fractional (3 ÷ 2^1 = 1.5) + dp-ceiling
  (2^-63) reconstruction, the truncated-offset bitstream error, and
  the `parse_payload` dispatch round trip. Harmless on non-Annex-H
  streams (Phase 4 on the profiles table).

- round 274 — two typed accessors on the already-parsed §D.2.25
  `ToneMappingBody` (SEI payload type 23, tone_mapping_info) surfacing
  the normative implicit *default end points* of the piece-wise linear
  mapping model (`tone_map_model_id == 3`). §D.2.25 defines `num_pivots`
  as "*the number of pivot points in the piece-wise linear mapping
  function without counting the two default end points, (0, 0) and
  (2^coded_data_bit_depth − 1, 2^target_bit_depth − 1)*" — only the
  interior `num_pivots` pivots carry signalled
  `(coded_pivot_value[i], target_pivot_value[i])` pairs; the two end
  points are implicit and never appear in the bitstream. New
  `ToneMappingBody::piecewise_default_end_points(&self) ->
  Option<((u32, u32), (u32, u32))>` materialises the start `(0, 0)` and
  the end `(2^coded_data_bit_depth − 1, 2^target_bit_depth − 1)` pair in
  the same `(coded_pivot_value, target_pivot_value)` domain as the
  stored interior pivots, computing the end value from the body's
  `coded_data_bit_depth` (8..=14 ⇒ coded end 255..=16383) and
  `target_bit_depth` (1..=16 ⇒ target end 1..=65535); the shifts are
  `checked_shl`-saturated so a hand-constructed out-of-spec body can't
  panic. Sibling accessor `piecewise_total_pivot_count(&self) ->
  Option<u32>` returns `num_pivots + 2`, the size of the assembled curve
  including the two implicit end points (u(16) `num_pivots` ⇒ total
  2..=65537, widened to `u32`). Both return `None` unless
  `tone_map_model_id == 3` — the implicit end points are defined only
  for the piece-wise linear model, so no inferred value exists for the
  linear / sigmoid / user-table / reserved models. 3 new lib unit tests
  pin the None-for-linear (model_id 0) branch, the typical case
  (coded 10 / target 8 ⇒ end (1023, 255), 2 interior pivots ⇒ total 4),
  and the max-legal-bit-depth case (coded 14 / target 16 ⇒ end
  (16383, 65535), zero interior pivots ⇒ total 2). Zero new SEI types;
  the typed-accessor delta closes the small §D.2.25 semantic gap left by
  the round-73 tone_mapping_info implementation (the implicit default
  end points were normatively defined but not materialised — only the
  interior signalled pivots were stored).

- round 271 — two typed bit-depth accessors on the already-parsed
  §D.2.21 `FilmGrainSeparateColourDescription` body (SEI payload type
  19, film_grain_characteristics). New
  `FilmGrainSeparateColourDescription::bit_depth_luma(&self) -> u8`
  surfaces the spec semantic `filmGrainBitDepth[0]` by applying the
  eq. D-14 derivation `filmGrainBitDepth[0] =
  film_grain_bit_depth_luma_minus8 + 8` ("*film_grain_bit_depth_luma_minus8
  plus 8 specifies the bit depth used for the luma component of the
  film grain characteristics specified in the SEI message*"). Sibling
  accessor `bit_depth_chroma(&self) -> u8` surfaces the shared
  `filmGrainBitDepth[1] == filmGrainBitDepth[2]` semantic via eq. D-15
  `filmGrainBitDepth[c] = film_grain_bit_depth_chroma_minus8 + 8` for
  c = 1, 2. Both on-wire `_minus8` carriers are u(3) (0..=7), so the
  results land in 8..=15 and always fit in `u8`. The returns are
  unconditional (not `Option`) because this struct is only constructed
  when `separate_colour_description_present_flag == 1`; the §D.2.21
  "not present ⇒ inferred to bit_depth_{luma,chroma}_minus8" rule is
  represented by the carrying `FilmGrainBody::separate_colour_description`
  being `None`, not by an in-struct sentinel. 4 new lib unit tests pin
  the typical 10-bit case (2 ⇒ 10 on both axes), the minimum 8-bit
  carrier (0 ⇒ 8), the u(3) ceiling plus an asymmetric luma/chroma
  pair (luma 7 ⇒ 15, chroma 4 ⇒ 12, proving the two accessors read
  independent carriers), and an end-to-end round trip through
  `parse_film_grain_characteristics` that fires the accessors on the
  parsed struct. Zero new SEI types added; the typed-accessor delta
  closes the small §D.2.21 semantic gap left by the round-73
  film_grain implementation (the parsed values were the biased on-wire
  u(3) `_minus8` carriers directly, not the spec's `filmGrainBitDepth`
  scalars).

- round 264 — typed `num_refinement_steps(&self) -> u64` accessor on
  the already-parsed §D.2.18 `ProgressiveRefinementSegmentStart` body
  (SEI payload type 16). The on-wire field is the classic `_minus1`
  bias per the spec text "*num_refinement_steps_minus1 plus 1
  indicates the maximum number of refinement steps that may be used
  during the refinement of the picture quality from the
  progressive_refinement_segment_start to the corresponding
  progressive_refinement_segment_end*", so the accessor surfaces the
  semantic `NumRefinementSteps = num_refinement_steps_minus1 + 1`
  directly. The `u64` return is the smallest unsigned type that can
  represent the full u(32) carrier range without overflow:
  `num_refinement_steps_minus1 == u32::MAX` yields
  `u32::MAX + 1 == 4_294_967_296`, one past `u32::MAX`. Return is
  unconditional (not `Option`) because the `_minus1` bias guarantees
  `NumRefinementSteps >= 1` for any well-formed payload — no
  unsignalled-flag sentinel exists, unlike the `Option`-returning
  accessors elsewhere in this module. 4 new lib unit tests pin: the
  minimum (0 ⇒ 1), a typical small segment (2 ⇒ 3), the u(32) ceiling
  (`u32::MAX` ⇒ `u32::MAX + 1 == 4_294_967_296` with no overflow), and
  an end-to-end round trip through `parse_progressive_refinement_segment_start`
  (id=5, steps_minus1=9 ⇒ NumRefinementSteps=10).

- round 259 — typed `sub_seq_duration_seconds(&self) -> Option<f64>`
  accessor on the already-parsed §D.2.13 (2024 spec) / §D.2.12 (2003
  draft) `SubSeqCharacteristics` body (SEI payload type 12). The
  on-wire `sub_seq_duration` field is a u(32) count of 90-kHz clock
  ticks per the spec text "*sub_seq_duration specifies the duration of
  the target sub-sequence in clock ticks of a 90-kHz clock*", so the
  accessor divides the carrier by `90_000` to surface the seconds
  scalar. Returns `None` when `duration_flag == 0` (the spec sentinel:
  "*duration_flag equal to 0 indicates that the duration of the target
  sub-sequence is not specified*") — `sub_seq_duration` is `None` in
  that case and no scalar derivation is defined. The `f64` return
  represents the full u(32) carrier range (0..=4_294_967_295 ticks ≈
  13.25 hours, since 4_294_967_295 / 90_000 ≈ 47_721.86 s) with only a
  lossless `u32 → f64` widening followed by a single divide. 7 new
  lib unit tests pin the None-when-unspecified branch, the minimum
  non-zero carrier (1 tick round-trips back to 1 within 1e-12 after
  multiplying by 90_000), the exact one-second carrier (90_000 ticks
  → 1.0), a common per-frame interval (3_000 ticks → 1/30 second), the
  u(32) ceiling (`u32::MAX` ticks → exact `f64::from(u32::MAX) /
  90_000.0`), and two end-to-end round trips through
  `parse_sub_seq_characteristics` covering the duration_flag=1 path
  (180_000 ticks → 2.0 s) and the duration_flag=0 path (mirrors the
  on-wire `None`). Zero new SEI types added; the delta closes the
  remaining §D.2.13 semantic gap from the round-99 implementation —
  the parsed value was the raw u(32) tick count, not the spec's
  seconds scalar.

- round 255 — two typed accessors on the already-parsed §D.2.13 (2024
  spec) / §D.2.12 (2003 draft) `sub_seq_layer_characteristics` body
  (SEI payload type 11), also re-used by §D.2.14 (payload type 12)
  under `SubSeqCharacteristics::average_rate`. New
  `SubSeqLayerCharacteristic::average_bit_rate_bps(&self) -> Option<u32>`
  multiplies the raw u(16) `average_bit_rate` field by 1000 to surface
  the bits-per-second semantic — the on-wire field is in units of
  1000 bits/second per §D.2.13 / equation D-6 ("*average_bit_rate
  indicates the average bit rate in units of 1000 bits per second*"),
  so the carrier is a pre-divided count. Sibling accessor
  `average_frame_rate_fps(&self) -> Option<f64>` divides the raw
  u(16) `average_frame_rate` field by 256 to surface the
  frames-per-second semantic — the on-wire field is in units of
  frames/(256 seconds) per §D.2.13 / equation D-8 ("*average_frame_rate
  indicates the average frame rate in units of frames/(256 seconds)*").
  Both accessors return `None` when the carrier is 0 — equations D-7 /
  D-9 (and the D-11 / D-13 mirror pair in §D.2.14) reserve the value
  0 for the degenerate `t1 == t2` case and the general "unspecified"
  reading; the spec defines no scalar derivation from a 0 carrier so
  no inferred value exists. The `u32` return on the bit-rate accessor
  is large enough for the on-wire ceiling (`65535 * 1000 = 65_535_000`,
  well under `u32::MAX`); the `f64` return on the frame-rate accessor
  represents the `1/256` quantisation step exactly (256 is a power of
  two so all on-wire values map to dyadic rationals with no rounding
  error). 8 new lib unit tests pin the None-when-zero branch, the
  minimum non-zero carrier (1 ⇒ 1000 bits/s and 1/256 fps), a typical
  bitrate (5000 ⇒ 5 Mbit/s), the u(16) bit-rate ceiling
  (65535 ⇒ 65.535 Mbit/s), the u(16) frame-rate ceiling
  (65535 ⇒ 65535/256 fps), exact-integer common frame rates
  (24/25/30 fps via 24*256 / 25*256 / 30*256 carriers), an end-to-end
  parse round trip through `parse_sub_seq_layer_characteristics`
  proving `bps()` / `fps()` survive the layer-vector wrapping, and a
  cross-payload round trip through `parse_sub_seq_characteristics`
  proving the same accessors fire on the `SubSeqCharacteristics::
  average_rate` carrier (payload type 12). Zero new SEI types added;
  the typed-accessor delta closes the small §D.2.13 semantic gap left
  by the round-99 implementation (the parsed values were the biased
  on-wire u(16) counts directly, not the spec's bits/s and fps
  scalars).

- round 253 — two typed accessors on the already-parsed §H.13.2.3
  `depth_representation_info` body (SEI payload type 50). New
  `DepthRepresentationInfo::depth_nonlinear_representation_num_segments(&self)
  -> Option<u8>` surfaces the spec semantic
  `DepthNonlinearRepresentationNumSegments` — the number of
  piecewise linear segments used to map decoded depth-view luma
  samples to a disparity-uniform scale — by applying the `+ 2`
  bias documented in §H.13.2.3 ("*depth_nonlinear_representation_num_minus1
  plus 2 specifies the number of piecewise linear segments…*").
  Sibling accessor
  `depth_nonlinear_representation_model_len(&self) -> Option<u8>`
  returns the `num_minus1 + 1` count of *signalled*
  `depth_nonlinear_representation_model[i]` entries — that is, the
  on-wire `i = 1..=num_minus1 + 1` loop bound from the §H.13.1.3
  syntax table, excluding the two trailing-coverage sentinels
  `model[0]` and `model[num_minus1 + 2]` that §H.13.2.3 pre-defines
  to `0`. Both accessors return `None` when the carrier is
  unsignalled (`depth_representation_type != 3`); the spec's
  piecewise model is only defined for type 3, so no inferred value
  exists for other types. The on-wire range
  `num_minus1 ∈ 0..=62` gives semantic ranges `2..=64` (segments)
  and `1..=63` (signalled model entries), both fitting in `u8`. 5
  new lib unit tests pin the None-when-absent branch, the minimum
  carrier (0 → 2 segments / 1 signalled entry), an interior
  carrier (3 → 5 / 4), the maximum on-wire carrier (62 → 64 / 63),
  and an end-to-end round trip through
  `parse_depth_representation_info` using the existing type-3
  fixture that proves the relations
  `model_len() == depth_nonlinear_representation_model.len()` and
  `num_segments() == model_len() + 1`. Zero new SEI types added;
  the typed-accessor delta closes the small §H.13.2.3 semantic gap
  left by round 231 (the parsed value was the biased ue(v)
  directly, not the spec's
  `DepthNonlinearRepresentationNumSegments`).

- round 250 — typed accessor on the already-parsed §H.13.2.4
  `three_dimensional_reference_displays_info` body (SEI payload
  type 51). New `ReferenceDisplay::num_sample_shift(&self) ->
  Option<i16>` surfaces the §H.13.2.4 signed semantic
  `NumSampleShift[i] = num_sample_shift_plus512[i] − 512` from the
  biased u(10) storage field. Returns `None` when
  `additional_shift_present_flag == 0` (§H.13.2.4 leaves the value
  unsignalled and does not define an inferred value); returns
  `Some(NumSampleShift[i])` otherwise. The §H.13.2.4 sign
  convention is documented inline on the method: negative →
  shift the left view left by `|NumSampleShift|` samples; zero →
  no shift; positive → shift the left view right by
  `NumSampleShift` samples. The return type is `i16` since the
  value fits in `−512..=511`. 6 new lib unit tests pin the
  None-when-absent branch, the centre value (biased 512 →
  semantic 0), a positive case (biased 768 → +256), a negative
  case (biased 256 → −256), the −512 / +511 endpoint pair
  exercising the full bitstream range (biased 0 and 1023), and an
  end-to-end round trip through
  `parse_three_dimensional_reference_displays_info` using the
  existing per-display fixture so the accessor's contract is
  wired to a real parse path. Zero new SEI types added; the
  typed-accessor delta closes the small §H.13.2.4 semantic gap
  left by round 226 (the parsed value was the biased u(10)
  directly, not the spec's signed `NumSampleShift[i]`).

- round 247 — third Annex H (3D-AVC) SEI payload implemented in
  `sei.rs`: payload type 53 `depth_sampling_info`
  (§H.13.1.7 / §H.13.2.7). Surfaces the depth/texture sample-size
  ratio (`dttsr_x_mul` / `dttsr_x_dp` for horizontal,
  `dttsr_y_mul` / `dttsr_y_dp` for vertical — each ratio is
  `dttsr_*_mul ÷ 2^dttsr_*_dp` per §H.13.2.7; the value 0 for
  `dttsr_*_mul` is reserved per §H.13.2.7 and is rejected before
  storage with the new
  `SeiError::DepthSamplingInfoDttsrMulReserved { axis }`) and the
  depth sampling grid position(s) for the IDR access unit's depth
  views relative to the same-`view_id` texture views. The
  `per_view_depth_grid_pos_flag` (u(1)) gates either a single
  shared `depth_grid_position()` (else-branch — surfaced as a
  single-entry `views` vector with a sentinel `depth_grid_view_id
  = 0`) or `num_video_plus_depth_views_minus1 + 1` per-view
  `(depth_grid_view_id[i], depth_grid_position())` entries.
  Anti-OOM pre-allocation cap on
  `num_video_plus_depth_views_minus1 ≤ 1023` (Annex G/H absolute
  `num_views_minus1` upper bound) + the same `view_id ≤ 1023`
  range check applied per entry. New §H.13.1.7.1
  `depth_grid_position()` sub-struct `DepthGridPosition` carries
  the raw `(pos_x_fp u(20), pos_x_dp u(4), pos_x_sign_flag u(1))`
  triple + the matching y triple;
  `DepthGridPosition::{x,y}_to_f64` reconstruct the §H.13.2.7.1
  signed fixed-point scalar
  `(1 − 2 * sign_flag) * (fp ÷ 2^dp)`. New
  `DepthSamplingInfo::{dttsr_x,dttsr_y}_to_f64` helpers
  reconstruct the §H.13.2.7 sample-size ratios. New `SeiError`
  variants `DepthSamplingInfoDttsrMulReserved { axis }` (axis is
  `"x"` or `"y"`), `DepthSamplingInfoNumViewsOutOfRange` and
  `DepthSamplingInfoViewIdOutOfRange { i }`. Wired into
  `parse_payload` dispatch; the payload-type doc-comment table at
  the top of `sei.rs` grows one row (§H.13.1.7).
  `tests/integration_sei_malformed.rs` `KNOWN_PAYLOAD_TYPES`
  table grows from 48 → 49 entries (type 53 wasn't in the
  fallback list either, so the sweep cardinality moves from 2992
  → 3036 panic-free invocations). 7 new lib unit tests cover the
  shared-position min path (1:1 sample-size ratio + zero grid
  position), a two-view per-view path with distinct fp/dp/sign-bit
  triples per view (and per-axis), rejection of
  `dttsr_x_mul = 0`, rejection of `dttsr_y_mul = 0`, rejection of
  `num_video_plus_depth_views_minus1 > 1023`, rejection of
  `depth_grid_view_id[0] > 1023`, and `parse_payload(53, …)`
  dispatch round-trip. Harmless on non-Annex-H streams (Phase 4
  on the profiles table).

- round 237 — first Annex I (3D-AVC depth coding) SEI payload
  implemented in `sei.rs`: payload type 54
  `constrained_depth_parameter_set_identifier`
  (§I.13.1.1 / §I.13.2.1). Per-CVS pair `(max_dps_id, max_dps_id_diff)`
  constraining the `depth_range_parameter_set_id` window so decoders
  can conclude losses of depth parameter set NAL units (§I.13.2.1
  NOTE 1) and maintain the running `MaxUsedDpsId` / `UsedDpsIdSet`
  state per slice (§I.13.2.1 eq. (I-86) sliding-window walk). Both
  fields are ue(v); the parser enforces both §I.13.2.1 normative
  constraints before storage: `max_dps_id ≤ 62` (derived from the
  `depth_parameter_set_id` range `1..=63` per §7.4.2.16, since
  `max_dps_id + 1` is the maximum allowed
  `depth_range_parameter_set_id` value) and
  `max_dps_id_diff * 2 < max_dps_id` (the §I.13.2.1 sliding-window
  integrity constraint; a violation would make the prev/min walk
  around eq. (I-86) ambiguous because the window would overlap
  itself). New `SeiError` variants
  `ConstrainedDepthParameterSetIdentifierMaxDpsIdOutOfRange` and
  `ConstrainedDepthParameterSetIdentifierDiffViolatesBound
  { max_dps_id_diff, max_dps_id }`. Wired into `parse_payload`
  dispatch; the payload-type doc-comment table at the top of `sei.rs`
  grows one row (§I.13.1.1).
  `tests/integration_sei_malformed.rs` lifts type 54 out of the
  `Unknown`-fallback set into the implemented group; sweep
  cardinality is preserved at 2992 panic-free invocations (one type
  migrated, total per-type count unchanged at 68). 7 new lib unit
  tests cover the min-legal pair (`max_dps_id = 1`,
  `max_dps_id_diff = 0`), a mid-range pair (`7`, `3`), the max-legal
  pair (`62`, `30`), rejection of `max_dps_id = 63`, rejection of
  `max_dps_id_diff = 2` when `max_dps_id = 4` (boundary `2 * 2 = 4`
  ⇒ NOT < 4), rejection of the all-zero pair (strict-less-than rules
  it out even without a diff), and `parse_payload` dispatch
  round-trip. Harmless on non-Annex-I streams (Phase 4 on the
  profiles table).

- round 231 — second Annex H (3D-AVC) SEI payload implemented in
  `sei.rs`: payload type 50 `depth_representation_info`
  (§H.13.1.3 / §H.13.2.3). Per-CVS depth / disparity range parameters
  per target view used by a renderer prior to display (e.g. for view
  synthesis on a 3D display). Surfaces `all_views_equal_flag` (u(1)),
  which gates whether `num_views_minus1` is signalled (when 1, the
  message describes one shared view; when 0, `num_views_minus1 + 1`
  per-view entries follow); `z_near_flag` / `z_far_flag` /
  `d_min_flag` / `d_max_flag` (each u(1)) gating the four
  §H.13.1.3.1 floating-point quadruples; the optional
  `z_axis_equal_flag` + `common_z_axis_reference_view` pair gated by
  `z_near_flag || z_far_flag`; `depth_representation_type` (ue(v)) —
  Table H-1 interpretation: 0 = inverse-Z, 1 = disparity, 2 = Z,
  3 = nonlinear-disparity, 4..=15 reserved (and the §H.13.2.3
  ignore-trailing-data rule is honoured by skipping the nonlinear
  tail when the value is not exactly 3); per-view
  `depth_info_view_id` / optional `z_axis_reference_view` (gated by
  `(z_near || z_far) && !z_axis_equal`) / optional
  `disparity_reference_view` (gated by `d_min || d_max`) (each ue(v)
  in 0..=1023); and, when `depth_representation_type == 3`, the
  §H.13.2.3 piecewise-linear `depth_nonlinear_representation_model[]`
  (count `num_minus1 + 1`, each entry ue(v) in 0..=65535, with the
  §H.13.2.3 DepthLUT construction's `i = 0` / `i = num_minus1 + 2`
  sentinels left implicit per the spec). New `DepthFloatComponent`
  carries the §H.13.1.3.1 element bitstream value verbatim
  (1-bit sign, 7-bit exponent, 5-bit mantissa_len_minus1, variable
  mantissa width = `da_mantissa_len_minus1 + 1` in 1..=32);
  `DepthFloatComponent::to_f64` reconstructs the Table H-2 scalar:
  denormal `(-1)^s * 2^(-(30 + v)) * n` for `e == 0`, normal
  `(-1)^s * 2^(e - 31) * (1 + n / 2^v)` for `0 < e < 127`, and
  `f64::NAN` for the reserved `e == 127` value. New `SeiError`
  variants `DepthRepresentationInfoNumViewsOutOfRange` (anti-OOM
  cap on the per-view loop allocation),
  `DepthRepresentationInfoViewIdOutOfRange { field }` (catch-all for
  the four 0..=1023 view-id range checks),
  `DepthRepresentationInfoNonlinearNumOutOfRange` (per §H.13.2.3 the
  spec range is 0..=62; pre-allocation cap on the nonlinear-model
  loop), and `DepthRepresentationInfoNonlinearModelOutOfRange { i }`
  (per §H.13.2.3 each model entry is 0..=65535). Wired into
  `parse_payload` dispatch; the payload-type table at the top of
  `sei.rs` grows one row (§H.13.1.3). The
  `tests/integration_sei_malformed.rs` `KNOWN_PAYLOAD_TYPES` table
  lifts type 50 out of the `FALLBACK_PAYLOAD_TYPES` set into the
  implemented group (46 → 47 entries; the per-type total is
  unchanged at 68, so the sweep cardinality stays at 2992 panic-free
  invocations). 8 new lib unit tests cover the minimum-syntax
  single-view path with all flags off, the two-view path with
  per-view `z_axis_reference_view` + per-view `ZNear` / `DMin` float
  quadruples, the type-3 nonlinear-tail path with one model entry,
  the reserved-type 4 ignore-trailing path, rejection of
  `num_views_minus1 > 1023`, rejection of
  `common_z_axis_reference_view > 1023`, rejection of
  `depth_nonlinear_representation_num_minus1 > 62`,
  `DepthFloatComponent::to_f64` branches (normal / negative-sign /
  denormal / reserved), and `parse_payload` dispatch round-trip.
  Harmless on non-Annex-H streams (Phase 4 on the profiles table).
- round 226 — first Annex H (3D-AVC) SEI payload implemented in
  `sei.rs`: payload type 51 `three_dimensional_reference_displays_info`
  (§H.13.1.4 / §H.13.2.4). Per-CVS reference-display list with
  reference baseline, reference display width, optional reference
  viewing distance, and per-display additional horizontal shift.
  Each scalar follows §H.13.2.4 Table H-3 (sign-less floating-point
  with 6-bit exponent and a variable-width mantissa from the same
  three-branch width formula used in §G.13.2.5 — `e == 0 → max(0,
  prec − 30)`, `0 < e < 63 → max(0, e + prec − 31)`, `e == 63 → 0`
  reserved). New `UnsignedFloatComponent` mirrors the round-213
  `FloatComponent` minus the sign bit; `to_f64()` reconstructs the
  Table H-3 scalar (`NaN` for the reserved `e == 63`). Surfaces
  `prec_ref_baseline`, `prec_ref_display_width`,
  `prec_ref_viewing_dist` (each ue(v) in 0..=31), `num_ref_displays_minus1`
  (ue(v) in 0..=31, anti-OOM pre-allocation cap), per-display
  `additional_shift_present_flag` + optional `num_sample_shift_plus512`
  (u(10), 0..=1023 naturally), and the trailing
  `three_dimensional_reference_displays_extension_flag` (u(1)). New
  `SeiError` variants `ThreeDimensionalReferenceDisplaysInfoPrecOutOfRange`
  and `ThreeDimensionalReferenceDisplaysInfoNumRefDisplaysOutOfRange`.
  Wired into `parse_payload` dispatch; the payload-type table at the
  top of `sei.rs` grows one row (§H.13.1.4). The
  `tests/integration_sei_malformed.rs` `KNOWN_PAYLOAD_TYPES` table
  moves type 51 into the implemented group (it wasn't in the
  fallback list either, so the sweep cardinality moves from 2948 →
  2992 panic-free invocations across 68 payload types × 11
  adversarial shapes × 4 contexts). 8 new lib unit tests cover the
  minimum-syntax single-display path, the two-display path with
  reference viewing distance + per-display additional shift, the
  trailing `extension_flag` propagation, `UnsignedFloatComponent::to_f64`
  branches (normal / denormal / reserved), rejection of
  `prec_ref_baseline == 32`, rejection of `prec_ref_viewing_dist
  == 32`, rejection of `num_ref_displays_minus1 == 32`, and
  `parse_payload` dispatch round-trip. Harmless on non-Annex-H
  streams (Phase 4 on the profiles table).
- round 219 — strict §7.3.1 dispatch on `nal_unit_type ∈ {14, 20, 21}`
  in `nal.rs`. `parse_nal_unit` now reads the leading
  `svc_extension_flag` (for types 14 / 20) or `avc_3d_extension_flag`
  (for type 21) and parses the matching three-byte NAL extension
  header per §F.7.3.1.1 (SVC), §G.7.3.1.1 (MVC, three bytes), or
  §I.7.3.1.1 (3D-AVC, two bytes). The MVC variant surfaces
  `non_idr_flag`, `priority_id` (u(6)), `view_id` (u(10), widened to
  `u16`), `temporal_id` (u(3)), `anchor_pic_flag`, `inter_view_flag`,
  and `reserved_one_bit`; the SVC variant surfaces `idr_flag`,
  `priority_id`, `no_inter_layer_pred_flag`, `dependency_id` (u(3)),
  `quality_id` (u(4)), `temporal_id`, `use_ref_base_pic_flag`,
  `discardable_flag`, `output_flag`, and `reserved_three_2bits`
  (u(2)); the 3D-AVC variant surfaces `view_idx` (u(8)), `depth_flag`,
  `non_idr_flag`, `temporal_id`, `anchor_pic_flag`, and
  `inter_view_flag`. Per §7.3.1 the emulation-prevention scan starts
  at `i = nalUnitHeaderBytes`, so the extension bytes themselves are
  read verbatim; only the post-extension RBSP body is fed through
  `rbsp_from_nal_payload`. New struct fields on `NalUnit`:
  `extension: Option<NalUnitHeaderExtension>` with the
  `Mvc / Svc / Avc3d` variants. New `NalError::TruncatedExtensionHeader`
  error variant fires when the NAL is too short for the dispatched
  extension width (≥ 3 bytes for SVC / MVC, ≥ 2 bytes for 3D-AVC).
  The §7.3.1 type-21 fall-through to the MVC three-byte body when
  `avc_3d_extension_flag == 0` is honoured (depth NAL referencing an
  MVC view component). `decoder.rs` still routes extension NAL types
  through `Event::Ignored`, but now does so against a
  spec-conformantly-parsed RBSP slice that no longer includes the
  extension bytes — observable through the
  `prefix_nal_14_is_ignored` regression test, which is widened from
  a two-byte payload (formerly tolerated; the spec requires at
  least three bytes) to a syntactically valid three-byte zero
  extension. Twelve new `nal::tests` cover MVC / SVC / 3D-AVC happy
  paths, max-field-value coverage of the bit-width boundaries, the
  three truncation modes, the §7.3.1 type-21 → MVC fall-through,
  and the emulation-prevention scoping rule (extension bytes
  preserved verbatim, RBSP body bytes still stripped).
- round 213 — new Annex G (MVC) SEI payload type implemented in
  `sei.rs`: payload type 40 `multiview_acquisition_info` (§G.13.1.5 /
  §G.13.2.5 — intrinsic + extrinsic camera parameters per view).
  Intrinsic block carries `prec_focal_length`, `prec_principal_point`,
  and `prec_skew_factor` (each ue(v) in 0..=31) plus a per-camera
  `(focal_length_x, focal_length_y, principal_point_x,
  principal_point_y, skew_factor)` five-tuple; when
  `intrinsic_params_equal_flag == 1` a single shared entry is signalled
  for all views. Extrinsic block carries `prec_rotation_param`,
  `prec_translation_param` (each ue(v) in 0..=31) plus a 3×3 rotation
  matrix `r[j][k]` and 3-vector translation `t[j]` per view in the
  §G.13.1.5 row-major spec order. Each scalar is decoded as the
  sign-exponent-mantissa floating-point form of §G.13.2.5: 1-bit sign,
  6-bit exponent, and a variable-width mantissa whose width follows
  the spec formula `e == 0 → max(0, prec − 30)`,
  `0 < e < 63 → max(0, e + prec − 31)`, `e == 63 → 0` (the spec
  reserves value 63 as "unspecified" without defining a mantissa
  width; we conservatively read no mantissa bits in that case so the
  bitstream cursor stays aligned). New `FloatComponent` (sign / exponent
  / mantissa raw bits / mantissa width) preserves the bitstream value
  verbatim; `FloatComponent::to_f64` reconstructs the §G.13.2.5
  IEEE-style scalar (denormal for `e == 0`, normal for `0 < e < 63`,
  `NaN` for `e == 63`). Anti-OOM pre-allocation cap on
  `num_views_minus1 ≤ 1023` (Annex G absolute, mirrors round-200's
  §G.13.2.8 pattern); explicit rejection of any `prec_* > 31`. New
  `SeiError` variants `MultiviewAcquisitionInfoNumViewsOutOfRange` and
  `MultiviewAcquisitionInfoPrecOutOfRange`. Wired into `parse_payload`
  dispatch; `tests/integration_sei_malformed.rs` `KNOWN_PAYLOAD_TYPES`
  table moves 40 out of the `Unknown`-fallback set (sweep cardinality
  preserved at 2948 panic-free invocations since 40 was already
  exercised in the fallback group). 8 new lib unit tests cover the
  no-flags happy path, intrinsic-only with shared camera entry,
  extrinsic-only with full 3×3 R + 3-vector T per camera, the
  §G.13.2.5 mantissa-width formula across all three branches
  (denormal / normal / reserved), `FloatComponent::to_f64`
  reconstruction (denormal + unity + −3.0 + reserved → NaN),
  rejection of `num_views_minus1 == 1024`, rejection of
  `prec_focal_length == 32`, and `parse_payload` dispatch round-trip.
  Harmless on non-MVC streams (Phase 4 on the README "Profiles +
  features in scope" table).

- round 207 — new Annex G (MVC) SEI payload type implemented in
  `sei.rs`: payload type 41 `non_required_view_component` (§G.13.1.6 /
  §G.13.2.6 — per-target-view list of `(view_order_index[i],
  index_delta_minus1[i][])` pairs, each pair recording the
  view-order-index of the target view plus the deltas locating the
  view components that are not needed to decode it). All four §G.13.2.6
  range bounds are enforced before storage:
  `num_info_entries_minus1 ≤ 1022` (pre-allocation cap derived from
  Annex G's absolute `num_views_minus1 ≤ 1023` per §G.13.2.10);
  `view_order_index[i] ∈ 1..=1023` (incl. the spec's lower bound of 1
  since view 0 is the base view, not a target);
  `num_non_required_view_components_minus1[i] ≤ view_order_index − 1`
  (pre-allocation, anti-OOM); and `index_delta_minus1[i][j] ≤
  view_order_index − 1`. Wired into `parse_payload` dispatch; the
  payload-type table at the top of `sei.rs` grows one row. New
  `SeiError` variants `NonRequiredViewComponentNumInfoEntriesOutOfRange`,
  `NonRequiredViewComponentViewOrderIndexOutOfRange`,
  `NonRequiredViewComponentCountOutOfRange`, and
  `NonRequiredViewComponentIndexDeltaOutOfRange`. The
  `tests/integration_sei_malformed.rs` `KNOWN_PAYLOAD_TYPES` table
  moves 41 out of the `Unknown`-fallback set, lifting the
  sweep-cardinality lock from 2904 → 2948 panic-free invocations. 7
  new lib unit tests cover the single-entry / two-entry happy path,
  rejection of `view_order_index == 0`, rejection of
  `num_info_entries_minus1 == 1023` (1 above the absolute cap),
  rejection of the per-entry inner count exceeding `view_order_index
  − 1`, rejection of an index delta exceeding `view_order_index − 1`,
  and `parse_payload` dispatch round-trip. Harmless on non-MVC streams
  (Phase 4 on the README "Profiles + features in scope" table).
- round 200 — two new Annex G (MVC) SEI payload types implemented in
  `sei.rs`: payload type 39 `multiview_scene_info` (§G.13.1.4 /
  §G.13.2.4 — single `max_disparity` ue(v), 0..=1023 range bound
  enforced before storage) and payload type 43
  `operation_point_not_present` (§G.13.1.8 / §G.13.2.8 — list of
  16-bit operation-point identifiers declared absent in the bitstream,
  with the §G.13.2.8 65536-id pre-allocation cap closing the same
  shape of OOM lever that the round-177 §D.2.20 fix removed for
  motion_constrained_slice_group_set, plus the 0..=65535 per-id range
  check). Both arms are wired into `parse_payload` dispatch; the
  payload-type table at the top of `sei.rs` grows two rows. New
  `SeiError` variants `MultiviewSceneInfoMaxDisparityOutOfRange`,
  `OperationPointNotPresentCountOutOfRange`, and
  `OperationPointNotPresentIdOutOfRange`. The
  `tests/integration_sei_malformed.rs` `KNOWN_PAYLOAD_TYPES` table
  moves 39 and 43 out of the `Unknown`-fallback set (which also lifts
  the sweep-cardinality lock from 2816 → 2904 panic-free invocations).
  10 new lib unit tests (5 per payload type) cover boundary 0,
  typical value, boundary 1023 / boundary 65535, count-overflow
  rejection, id-overflow rejection, and `parse_payload` dispatch
  round-trip. Harmless on non-MVC streams (Phase 4 on the README
  "Profiles + features in scope" table).
- round 194 — `parse_residual_block_cavlc` rejects malformed §7.3.5.3.1
  call-contract triples (`startIdx > endIdx`, `maxNumCoeff ∉ {4, 8, 15, 16}`,
  span exceeding `maxNumCoeff`) before any bit is read; new `CavlcError`
  variants `InvalidBlockSpan` / `InvalidMaxNumCoeff` / `BlockSpanExceedsMax`
- round 194 — sweep `fuzz/artifacts/panic_free_decode/` (4 local oom-*
  artifacts cleared by round-177 §D.2.20 + round-187 §8.2.1 i64 staging;
  re-fed through `panic_free_decode -runs=1`, all exit 0 in 0 ms within
  libFuzzer's default 2 GiB RSS budget — the artifacts directory is
  git-ignored so the prune is a local-disk operation) + new
  `fuzz/README.md` documenting the harness layout, the round-194 sweep,
  and the local-rerun recipe

### Added

- **round 192 — ISO/IEC 14496-15 §5.2.4.1.1 strict avcC parser +
  High-profile extension trailer.** `H264CodecDecoder::consume_extradata`
  now (a) rejects `lengthSizeMinusOne == 2` (3-byte length prefix) at
  the avcC header, as required by §5.2.4.1.1 — previously the illegal
  value silently flowed into `AvccSplitter`, which rejected it later
  with a less specific error; (b) parses the §5.2.4.1.1 High-family
  extension (`chroma_format`, `bit_depth_luma_minus8`,
  `bit_depth_chroma_minus8`, `numOfSequenceParameterSetExt` + SPS-Ext
  NAL list) when `AVCProfileIndication ∈ {100, 110, 122, 144, 244}`,
  rather than leaving up to 4+ trailing bytes silently dropped; (c)
  enforces the §7.4.2.1.1 `bit_depth_*_minus8 ≤ 6` cap before the
  values reach any consumer. New diagnostic accessors
  `avcc_profile_idc()` / `avcc_level_idc()` / `avcc_chroma_format()` /
  `avcc_bit_depth_luma()` / `avcc_bit_depth_chroma()` surface what the
  avcC header advertised — useful for cross-checking against the
  in-band SPS on streams where the two disagree (the SPS still wins).
  Records that elide the High-family extension trailer are still
  accepted (some real-world muxers truncate it); the accessors stay
  `None` in that case. 11 new tests in `src/h264_decoder.rs` pin: the
  baseline + 1-byte + 2-byte prefix accept paths, the
  `lengthSizeMinusOne == 2` reject, wrong configurationVersion reject,
  short-header reject, profile_idc 100 + 244 extension parse, missing
  extension toleration, and the §7.4.2.1.1 bit-depth overflow / SPS
  truncation rejections.

### Fixed

- **round 187 — §8.2.1 POC derivation overflow now structured, not
  a panic.** Nightly `panic_free_decode` libfuzzer run #26632302094
  surfaced a debug-build `attempt to add with overflow` at
  `src/poc.rs:225` inside `derive_type0`'s eq. 8-5 frame branch
  (`TopFieldOrderCnt + delta_pic_order_cnt_bottom`, i32+i32). The
  `Decoder` trait contract is that adversarial bytes surface as
  `Err(...)` from `send_packet` — never a process-killing panic —
  so the i32 arithmetic in §8.2.1.1 eq. 8-3 / 8-4 / 8-5 was lifted
  into i64 staging, the §8.2.1.2 / §8.2.1.3 silent `as i32` tail
  truncations were replaced with `i32::try_from`, and a new
  `PocError::Overflow` variant carries the §C.4-mandated
  i32-PicOrderCnt invariant violation back to the caller. The
  decoder driver in `h264_decoder.rs` already maps `PocError` to
  `Error::invalid(...)`, so the affected slice is now skipped (and
  logged) instead of aborting the process.

  Four new unit tests in `src/poc.rs` pin the structured-error
  contract per algorithm (type 0 eq. 8-5 frame branch overflow,
  type 0 eq. 8-3 negative msb-wrap overflow, type 1 eq. 8-10
  frame-branch overflow against an i32::MAX × 10 cycle, type 2
  eq. 8-12 doubling overflow against `prev_frame_num_offset` ≈
  i32::MAX / 2). A new integration regression
  (`fuzz_crash_1743a9ce_poc_eq_8_5_frame_branch_overflow_does_not_panic`)
  embeds the 596-byte libfuzzer artefact verbatim so CI exercises
  the previously panicking path on every run; surviving the
  `send_packet` / `flush` / `receive_frame` round trip without a
  panic IS the assertion. All 22 pre-existing POC unit tests plus
  the round-187 additions keep passing.

### Added

- **round 183 — Annex G §G.13.2.10 multiview_view_position SEI
  (payload type 46).** Wires the per-CVS view-position SEI from the
  MVC family into the SEI dispatch table at payload type 46. The
  syntax (§G.13.1.10) is three fields: `num_views_minus1` ue(v),
  `view_position[i]` ue(v) for `i = 0..=num_views_minus1`, and a
  trailing `multiview_view_position_extension_flag` u(1). Each ue(v)
  is bounded at 1023 inclusive per §G.13.2.10 before allocation, so
  an adversarial input can never drive the per-view vector past 1024
  entries — the `num_views_minus1` check fires before
  `Vec::with_capacity` runs. The extension flag is preserved
  verbatim so callers auditing a non-conforming stream (§G.13.2.10
  requires the flag equal 0) can distinguish a clean stream from a
  reserved-extension marker. Two new `SeiError` variants
  (`MultiviewViewPositionNumViewsOutOfRange`,
  `MultiviewViewPositionViewPositionOutOfRange`) surface the bound
  failures with the offending value + index.

  New unit tests cover: two-view left/right ordering, single-view
  zero-position degenerate case, extension-flag-preserved-when-set,
  rejection of `num_views_minus1 = 1024` before allocation,
  rejection of `view_position[i] = 1024`, and the `parse_payload`
  dispatcher routing payload type 46 to the new variant. The
  malformed-input integration sweep (`integration_sei_malformed.rs`)
  pulls payload type 46 into `KNOWN_PAYLOAD_TYPES` so the existing
  panic-free contract automatically extends to the new parser
  across all 11 adversarial shapes × 4 contexts.

  SEI dispatch arm count goes 40 → 41. This is the first §G.13.2
  (Annex G — MVC) SEI parser to land; the rest of Annex G/H/I
  (24–44, 48–54, 181) remains deferred to Phase 4 alongside the
  matching `nal_unit_type` 14/15/20/21 prefix/subset-SPS handling.

### Fixed

- **round 177 — `sei_payload` fuzz target OOM (artifact
  `oom-1bf45ba3a116aa21631ccf3b3cec29fed395ef0e`, 11 bytes, reported
  by oxideav-h264 fuzz CI run 26569743256).** §D.2.20
  motion_constrained_slice_group_set's
  `parse_motion_constrained_slice_group_set` read
  `num_slice_groups_in_set_minus1` as a raw `ue(v)` and pushed
  `count = num_slice_groups_in_set_minus1 + 1` entries into the
  slice_group_id vector before checking the §D.2.20 range bound.
  When the active PPS only declares a single slice group, the
  encoded width of each slice_group_id field collapses to 0 bits
  per §D.1.20 (`Ceil(Log2(num_slice_groups))`), so each iteration
  consumed zero payload bits — letting an adversarial `ue(v)` value
  near 2^28 drive a ~1 GiB allocation and trip libfuzzer's
  rss_limit. The fix reads the same `ue(v)` and immediately
  enforces the §D.2.20 normative bound
  `num_slice_groups_in_set_minus1 ≤ num_slice_groups_minus1` (where
  `num_slice_groups_minus1` arrives via `SeiContext::num_slice_groups`),
  returning the new
  `SeiError::MotionConstrainedSliceGroupCountTooLarge` before the
  loop allocates. Each `slice_group_id[i]` then gets the §7.4.2.2 /
  §D.2.20 per-id range check (`< num_slice_groups`), surfaced as
  `SeiError::MotionConstrainedSliceGroupIdOutOfRange`.

  New `tests/integration_sei_malformed.rs` test
  `motion_constrained_slice_group_set_unbounded_count_is_rejected`
  replays the exact 11-byte fuzz artifact's path-2 payload tail
  (first byte 0x90 used for the §D.2.20 `SeiContext` derivation;
  remaining 10 bytes as the raw payload) and asserts the parser
  returns a deterministic `Err` rather than allocating its way to
  OOM. The two existing motion_constrained_slice_group_set tests
  (`single_group_collapses_width` /
  `multi_group_reads_u_v`) continue to pass — the bound is
  consistent with their `num_slice_groups_in_set_minus1` values
  (0 < 1 and 1 < 4 respectively). All 1033 lib tests + 5
  `integration_sei_malformed` tests pass.

### Added

- **round 164 — SEI parser hardening (new cargo-fuzz target +
  malformed-input property sweep).** Two complementary additions
  exercise the Annex D SEI surface that the existing whole-decoder
  fuzz targets reach only when libFuzzer happens to synthesise a
  well-formed Annex-B NAL→RBSP→sei_payload framing — i.e. almost
  never. Together they bring the 40-payload SEI dispatcher under the
  same panic-free contract the rest of the public Decoder surface
  has carried since round 120.

  `fuzz/fuzz_targets/sei_payload.rs` — new cargo-fuzz binary that
  feeds raw libFuzzer bytes through three SEI-parsing paths: (1) the
  full envelope (`parse_sei_rbsp`) and then `parse_payload` on every
  extracted message; (2) `parse_payload` directly with a payload type
  chosen from a 63-entry fixed pool (every dispatcher arm + several
  `Unknown`-fallback sentinels covering Annex F/G/H/I numeric
  ranges); (3) `parse_payload` on the full input under a second
  payload-type selector. A `context_from_byte` helper derives a
  varied-but-bounded `SeiContext` from the input so the VUI-gated
  branches (`buffering_period`, `pic_timing`,
  `dec_ref_pic_marking_repetition`, `spare_pic`, the §D.1.20
  `num_slice_groups`-dependent u(v) width) are reached without
  requiring libFuzzer to discover them. The new binary sits adjacent
  to the existing `panic_free_decode` / `ffmpeg_oracle_decode`
  binaries.

  `tests/integration_sei_malformed.rs` — deterministic property
  sweep covering every (payload_type, shape, context) triple in the
  matrix the fuzz target explores, so CI catches a regression even
  without libFuzzer. The grid is 40 known + 23 fallback payload
  types × 11 adversarial shapes (empty / one_zero / eight_zeros /
  sixtyfour_zeros / one_ff / eight_ffs / sixtyfour_ffs /
  max_ueg_prefix / alt_55_aa / alt_aa_55 / long_zeros_then_stop) ×
  4 `SeiContext` cells (`default` / `nal_hrd_present_24bit` /
  `vcl_hrd_present_4sched` / `max_lengths_8sg`) = 2772 invocations
  of `parse_payload`, asserted to never panic. Three companion
  tests cover the envelope-only path
  (`sei_parse_rbsp_never_panics`), the envelope-then-dispatch
  composition (`sei_envelope_then_dispatch_never_panics`), and the
  `SeiPayload::Unknown` catch-all contract
  (`sei_unknown_payload_type_is_ok`). The cardinality is explicitly
  pinned (2772) so a future change that accidentally drops a
  payload-type row or shape entry fails loudly instead of silently
  shrinking coverage.

  No behaviour change — `parse_payload` and `parse_sei_rbsp` are
  unchanged. This round is hardening only: it locks in the
  panic-free contract on the SEI surface and gives a defined surface
  for future libFuzzer runs to target without re-deriving the
  framing.

- **round 158 — typed ATSC1 envelope sub-parser on top of
  `user_data_registered_itu_t_t35` (§D.2.6).** Adds
  `parse_atsc1_envelope(payload_bytes)` consuming the post-country-code
  bytes of a country=0xB5 (USA) T.35 payload and decoding the ATSC1
  envelope per ATSC A/53 Part 4 (2009) §6.2.3:
  * `provider_code` (u(16) BE) — validated to be `0x0031` (the ATSC slot
    in the T.35 administered provider registration).
  * `user_identifier` (u(32) BE) — validated to be one of the two
    registered ATSC values per Table 6.7: `'GA94'` (0x47413934 →
    `ATSC_user_data()`) or `'DTG1'` (0x44544731 → `afd_data()`).
  * For `'GA94'`: reads `user_data_type_code` (u(8)) per Table 6.8 and
    dispatches per Table 6.9 — `0x03` surfaces the inner `MPEG_cc_data()`
    bytes opaquely (the inner cc_data() byte layout is normatively in
    CEA-708 [1] Table 2 which is **not present in this docs tree** — see
    docs-gap note below), `0x06` parses `bar_data()` per Table 6.11
    (top/bottom letterbox + left/right pillarbox pairs, reserved nibble
    + per-value '11' one_bits validation + §6.2.3.2 mutual-exclusion
    enforcement), any other code surfaces as `Atsc1UserData::Reserved`
    with raw bytes preserved per §6.2.2 silent-discard rule.
  * For `'DTG1'`: parses `afd_data()` per Table 6.13 / §6.2.4.2 (1 byte
    when `active_format_flag = 0`, 2 bytes when `1` carrying the 4-bit
    `active_format` value from Table 6.14).

  New public surface in `crate::sei`: `Atsc1Envelope`, `Atsc1Body`,
  `Atsc1UserData`, `Atsc1UserIdentifier` (with `GA94` / `DTG1`
  constants), `BarData`, `AfdData`, and `parse_atsc1_envelope`. Ten new
  `SeiError` variants pin the validation failures
  (`Atsc1EnvelopeTooShort`, `Atsc1ProviderCodeMismatch`,
  `Atsc1UnknownUserIdentifier`, `Atsc1AtscUserDataEmpty`,
  `Atsc1BarDataReservedMismatch`, `Atsc1BarDataOneBitsMismatch`,
  `Atsc1BarDataTopBottomMismatch`, `Atsc1BarDataLeftRightMismatch`,
  `Atsc1BarDataLetterboxPillarboxBoth`, `Atsc1BarDataTruncated`).

  Sixteen new `sei::tests::atsc1_*` unit tests cover: GA94+cc_data
  round-trip with the raw cc_data bytes passed through verbatim;
  GA94+bar_data letterbox + pillarbox decode at line/pixel values from
  the worked example in §6.2.3.2; rejections for top≠bottom, left≠right,
  reserved≠'1111', one_bits≠'11', and simultaneous letterbox+pillarbox;
  GA94+reserved type-code preserving raw bytes for diagnostics; GA94
  empty body rejected; DTG1+AFD flag-off (1-byte) and flag-on (2-byte
  with `active_format = '1010'` 16:9 letterbox); 6-byte minimum size
  enforcement; wrong provider_code (0x003C HDR10+) rejected; unknown
  user_identifier rejected; and an end-to-end chain through
  `parse_payload(4, …)` → `UserDataRegisteredItuTT35` →
  `parse_atsc1_envelope`. 1033 lib tests + 1243 total tests pass with
  the new module wired in (was 1017 + 1227).

  Spec basis: ATSC A/53 Part 4 (2009) §6.2.3 Tables 6.7 / 6.8 / 6.9 /
  6.10 / 6.11 / 6.13 / 6.14 (`docs/broadcast/atsc/A53-Part-4-2009.pdf`);
  Rec. ITU-T H.264 (08/2024) §D.1.6 / §D.2.6 for the outer
  `user_data_registered_itu_t_t35` carriage; ITU-T T.35 §3.1 for the
  country_code / extension semantics.

  **Docs-gap** — CEA-708 (the spec carrying the cc_data() Table 2 byte
  layout: `process_cc_data_flag` + `cc_count` + per-triple `cc_valid` /
  `cc_type` / `cc_data_1` / `cc_data_2` + DTVCC packet framing) is not
  present in `docs/`. Until it lands, ATSC1 `MPEG_cc_data` inner bytes
  stay opaque (the round-158 parser hands them through unchanged for a
  downstream CEA-708-aware consumer). Adding CEA-708-D to
  `docs/broadcast/cea/` would unblock a typed `CcData` decoder returning
  the per-triple (cc_type, cc_data_1, cc_data_2) array.

- **round 151 — opt-in CABAC IDR Intra_16x16 chroma AC trellis
  quantisation.** Extends the round-148 luma-AC trellis to the chroma
  Intra_16x16 paths. For 4:2:0 the lever refines the 4 per-block 4×4
  AC arrays per chroma plane (Cb / Cr) inside
  `encode_chroma_intra16x16_420`; for 4:4:4 the lever refines the 16
  per-block 4×4 AC arrays per chroma plane inside
  `encode_chroma_intra16x16_444` (§7.3.5.3 "chroma coded like luma").
  Each block is passed through
  `crate::encoder::transform::trellis_refine_4x4_ac` with
  `skip_dc=true` so the §8.5.11.1 2×2 chroma-DC Hadamard chain (4:2:0)
  or the §8.5.10 luma-style 4×4 DC Hadamard chain on the 4:4:4 chroma
  plane stays bit-exact. New `EncoderConfig::trellis_quant_intra_chroma`
  toggle (default `false`) gates the refinement. Bitstream syntax is
  unchanged; the decoder is unaffected; `cbp_chroma` keeps the §7.4.5.1
  Table 7-15 value (`0`/`1`/`2` based purely on whether DC and / or AC
  remains non-zero across the MB). The default stays off for the same
  reason as `trellis_quant_intra`: the round-49 rate model is
  calibrated for inter blockCat 2 (Luma4x4) and is roughly net-zero on
  dense intra chroma AC at typical QP — re-calibrating for chroma
  blockCats 4 (ChromaACLevel @ 4:2:0) and 1 (Intra16x16AC @ 4:4:4,
  treated like luma) so the lever can ship default-on is the obvious
  follow-up. New `integration_trellis_quant_intra_chroma.rs` pins six
  guarantees: 4:2:0 and 4:4:4 default-off byte-for-byte determinism;
  4:2:0 decoder self-roundtrip bit-exact on all three planes at QP=22;
  4:4:4 decoder self-roundtrip bit-exact on all three planes at QP=22;
  QP {18..42} sweep stays decodable + plane-wise bit-exact; luma PSNR
  invariant under the chroma lever; and a measurement-only byte-savings
  print across QP {18..38}. Spec basis: §8.5.10, §8.5.11.1, §7.3.5.3,
  §7.4.5.1, §9.3.3.1.3.

- **round 148 — opt-in CABAC IDR Intra_16x16 luma AC trellis
  quantisation.** Extends the round-49 `D + λ·R` refinement
  (`crate::encoder::transform::trellis_refine_4x4_ac`) to the 16 per-
  block 4x4 AC arrays inside an Intra_16x16 luma MB on the
  `encode_idr_cabac` path. Each block is passed through the trellis
  with `skip_dc=true` so the §8.5.10 inverse-Hadamard DC chain stays
  bit-exact while higher-frequency AC levels can shrink toward zero.
  New `EncoderConfig::trellis_quant_intra` toggle (default `false`)
  gates the refinement. Bitstream syntax is unchanged; the decoder
  is unaffected; `cbp_luma` keeps the §7.4.5.1 Table 7-11 value
  (`15` whenever any AC remains non-zero across the MB). The default
  stays off because the round-49 rate model is calibrated for inter
  blockCat 2 (Luma4x4) and is net-negative on dense intra
  Intra_16x16 AC at low QP — re-calibrating for blockCat 1
  (Intra16x16AC) so the lever can ship default-on is the obvious
  follow-up. New `integration_trellis_quant_intra.rs` pins four
  guarantees: default-off byte-for-byte determinism, decoder self-
  roundtrip bit-exact at QP=22, PSNR drift inside a 3 dB envelope
  across QP {22, 28, 34}, and QP {18..42} sweep stays decodable +
  bit-exact (max enc/dec luma diff = 0). Spec basis: §8.5.10, §8.5.12,
  §7.4.5.1, §9.3.3.1.3.

- **round 145 — end-to-end Criterion `encode` benchmark.** Adds
  `benches/encode.rs`, sibling to `benches/decode.rs`, exercising
  the public encoder entry points across seven in-process variants
  with no on-disk fixtures: 64x64 + 128x96 Baseline CAVLC IDR;
  Baseline IDR + 4×P CAVLC chain (real P-slice ME); Main IDR + P +
  B (§8.4.1.2.2 spatial-direct + bipred); 64x64 CABAC IDR
  (`encode_idr_cabac`); 64x64 CABAC IDR + P
  (`encode_idr_cabac` + `encode_p_cabac`, exercises the round-49
  trellis-quant refinement that's on by default); 64x64 High 4:2:2
  IDR (§8.5.11.2 4×2 chroma DC Hadamard). Criterion reports both
  per-frame (`Throughput::Elements`, "Kelem/s" ≈ frames-encoded
  per second) and per-source-byte (`Throughput::Bytes`,
  MiB/s of raw planar input absorbed) views per variant. Measured
  headline numbers on an Apple M-series host (Criterion `--quick`,
  release profile): CABAC IDR ~18.3 Kelem/s (107 MiB/s of source);
  CAVLC Baseline IDR 64x64 ~2.7 Kelem/s (17 MiB/s); CAVLC IDR + 4×P
  chain 207 elem/s (1.22 MiB/s — ME-dominated); Main IPB GOP
  176 elem/s; CABAC IDR + P 685 elem/s. Complements the existing
  `inter_pred_bench`, `transform_bench`, and `decode` benches —
  the encode hot path was previously unmeasured.

- **round 139 — end-to-end Criterion `decode` benchmark.** Adds
  `benches/decode.rs` driving the public `H264CodecDecoder`
  (`send_packet` + `flush` + `receive_frame`) across five
  in-process corpora generated by `oxideav-h264`'s own encoder so
  the bench is self-contained and needs no on-disk fixtures:
  64x64 Baseline IDR, 128x96 Baseline IDR, IDR + 4×P Baseline
  chain, IDR + P + B Main GOP (spatial-direct B), and a 64x64
  High 4:2:2 IDR. Criterion reports both per-frame
  (`Throughput::Elements`) and per-byte (`Throughput::Bytes`)
  numbers per variant. Headline decode rates on an Apple M-series
  host range from ~6 Kelem/s (128x96 Baseline IDR) to ~21 Kelem/s
  (IDR + 4×P chain, amortised over 5 frames per access unit).
  Complements the existing `inter_pred_bench` (motion-compensation
  kernels) and `transform_bench` (inverse-transform kernels),
  which only measured isolated hot paths.

### Fixed

- **round 128 — CAVLC I_PCM macroblock now honours `BitDepthY` /
  `BitDepthC` from the active SPS (§7.4.5 / §7.4.2.1.1).** Before this
  round, the CAVLC `I_PCM` path in `macroblock_layer.rs` hard-coded
  `bit_depth_y = bit_depth_c = 8`, so `pcm_sample_luma[i]` and
  `pcm_sample_chroma[i]` were always read as 8-bit values regardless
  of `bit_depth_luma_minus8` / `bit_depth_chroma_minus8` on the SPS.
  For a High10 (BitDepthY = 10) sequence with an `I_PCM` MB this
  would truncate every sample to its low 8 bits and leave the bit
  reader off by `(256 + 2 * MbWidthC * MbHeightC) * (BitDepth - 8)`
  bits — corrupting all subsequent macroblocks in the slice.

  Fix threads `bit_depth_luma_minus8` / `bit_depth_chroma_minus8`
  through `EntropyState` (new fields, defaulting to 0 for parser
  unit-test call sites) and reads them in the CAVLC PCM loop. The
  CABAC PCM path in `slice_data.rs` already consulted the SPS
  directly, so no behavioural change there beyond forwarding the
  same fields into its `EntropyState`. New regression
  `slice_data::tests::cavlc_i_pcm_macroblock_10bit_high10_round_trips`
  emits a single 10-bit `I_PCM` MB with samples that explicitly
  require bits 8..=9 and asserts byte-for-byte round-trip through
  `parse_slice_data`.

- **fuzz: round-125 / task #1044 — reject PPS that arrives BEFORE its
  referenced SPS (§7.4.1.2.1 / §7.4.2.2).** Closes the
  `ffmpeg_oracle_decode` divergence flagged on
  `crash-065436ed80e17520598536327afceed7133b3122` (359 B) and the
  resulting scheduled-Fuzz-job redness on master since round 120. The
  crash input delivered a PPS NAL ahead of its backing SPS; our
  `process_nal` PPS branch used to fall back to a guessed
  `chroma_format_idc = 1` in that case, store the PPS anyway, and let
  the IDR slices that arrived later activate it and emit two 16x16
  frames. libavcodec rejects the PPS at NAL arrival time
  ("sps_id 0 out of range", referring to the unstored backing SPS) and
  produces zero frames.

  Per §7.4.2.2 the PPS scaling-matrix tail loop length depends on
  the referenced SPS's `chroma_format_idc` (4:4:4 carries 6 8x8 lists;
  everything else carries 2 when `transform_8x8_mode_flag` is set),
  so the PPS cannot be parsed unambiguously when the SPS hasn't been
  seen yet — the previous "parse with default, replace if SPS turns
  up later" code path was correct only for 4:2:0 streams without a
  PPS scaling matrix.

  Fix sits in `Decoder::process_nal` (PPS branch): peek the
  `seq_parameter_set_id`, look up the SPS, and return
  `DecoderError::UnknownSps(sps_id)` when it isn't stored. The
  permissive 4:2:0 fallback is removed; only the SPS-driven
  `chroma_format_idc` reaches `Pps::parse_with_chroma_format`.

  Regression: `tests/integration_fuzz_oracle_regression.rs::
  fuzz_crash_065436ed_pps_before_sps_rejected` pins the exact
  359-byte payload and asserts the decoder reports `Error::Eof`
  with zero frames. The pre-existing
  `slice_referencing_pps_with_unknown_sps_is_rejected` test in
  `src/decoder.rs` is renamed to
  `pps_referencing_unknown_sps_is_rejected_at_storage` and now
  asserts the rejection happens at PPS arrival (not at slice
  activation), with neither PPS storage nor active-pps state
  committed.

### Added

- **sei: round-120 — sei_manifest + sei_prefix_indication Annex D SEI
  payloads (types 200 and 201).** Adds `sei_manifest` (§D.1.36 / §D.2.36)
  and `sei_prefix_indication` (§D.1.37 / §D.2.37) of
  `docs/video/h264/T-REC-H.264-202408-I.pdf`, bringing the typed-SEI
  surface from 38 to 40 recognised payloads. These are transport- and
  systems-layer hint messages — `sei_manifest` advertises, for the
  entire coded video sequence, which SEI payload types are expected to
  be present along with a per-type "necessary / unnecessary /
  undetermined / not-expected" classification from Table D-12, and
  `sei_prefix_indication` carries one or more leading bit-strings from
  the start of an upcoming SEI payload of a given
  `prefix_sei_payload_type` so a transport element can inspect the
  first few syntax elements (e.g. `frame_packing_arrangement_type` for
  type 45) without parsing the full SEI message.

  New `parse_sei_manifest` reads `manifest_num_sei_msg_types u(16)`
  then per entry `manifest_sei_payload_type[ i ] u(16)` and
  `manifest_sei_description[ i ] u(8)`. Descriptions 0..=3 are
  surfaced as `SeiManifestDescription::{NotExpected,
  ExpectedNecessary, ExpectedUnnecessary, ExpectedUndetermined}`; per
  §D.2.36 values 4..=255 are reserved and must be passed through (so
  callers can honour "Decoders shall allow ... shall ignore" for both
  the manifest entry and any SEI prefix indication keyed off the same
  payload type) — these land as `Reserved(raw)`. The §D.2.36
  uniqueness constraint (`manifest_sei_payload_type[ m ] !=
  manifest_sei_payload_type[ n ] for m != n`) is enforced at parse
  time via `SeiManifestDuplicatePayloadType { payload_type, first,
  second }`.

  New `parse_sei_prefix_indication` reads
  `prefix_sei_payload_type u(16)`, `num_sei_prefix_indications_minus1
  u(8)`, then for each indication `num_bits_in_prefix_indication_minus1
  u(16)` (the data field's bit count is value + 1), packs that many
  `sei_prefix_data_bit u(1)` values MSB-first into a `Vec<u8>` (length
  `bit_count.div_ceil(8)`), and consumes the §D.1.37
  byte-alignment trailer (`while !byte_aligned() { f(1) }`). A
  `SeiPrefixIndicationOverflow { i, bits, available }` rejects an
  indication whose declared `bit_count` exceeds the remaining payload
  bits — the existing fuzzed bitstream EOF check already guards the
  individual `u(1)` reads but the upfront check shortens the failure
  path on hostile inputs.

  Wired into `parse_payload(200, …)` → `SeiPayload::SeiManifest` and
  `parse_payload(201, …)` → `SeiPayload::SeiPrefixIndication`.
  Thirteen new unit tests in `src/sei.rs`: SEI manifest empty / single
  entry / three-entry mixed / reserved-description / duplicate
  rejection / truncated input / `parse_payload` dispatch; SEI prefix
  indication single byte-aligned / short bit-string with `1`-fill
  byte-alignment trailer / two entries with mixed bit-widths /
  oversized-bit-count rejection / truncated-header rejection /
  `parse_payload` dispatch. Lib-test count 1003 → 1016 (+13).

- **sei: round-113 — regionwise_packing Annex D SEI payload (type 155).**
  Adds `regionwise_packing` (§D.1.35.4 / §D.2.35.4 of
  `docs/video/h264/T-REC-H.264-202408-I.pdf`), bringing the typed-SEI
  surface from 36 to 37 recognised payloads and completing the
  omnidirectional projection family alongside equirectangular (150),
  cubemap (151), sphere_rotation (154), and omni_viewport (156). The
  message describes the region-wise packing transformation that maps
  regions of the cropped decoded ("packed") picture onto a projected
  picture, plus optional per-region guard bands. New
  `parse_regionwise_packing` reads `rwp_cancel_flag u(1)`; when not
  cancelled it reads `rwp_persistence_flag u(1)`,
  `constituent_picture_matching_flag u(1)`, `rwp_reserved_zero_5bits
  u(5)` (read and ignored), `num_packed_regions u(8)`,
  `proj_picture_width`/`proj_picture_height u(32)`, and
  `packed_picture_width`/`packed_picture_height u(16)`, then one
  `PackedRegion` per region: `rwp_reserved_zero_4bits u(4)` (ignored),
  `transform_type u(3)` (Table D-11, 0..=7), `guard_band_flag u(1)`,
  the four `proj_region_*` `u(32)` and four `packed_region_*` `u(16)`
  geometry fields, and — when `guard_band_flag` is set — a `GuardBand`
  carrying the four `*_gb_*` `u(8)` widths/heights,
  `gb_not_used_for_pred_flag u(1)`, the four `gb_type[j] u(3)` edge
  types, and `rwp_gb_reserved_zero_3bits u(3)` (ignored). Parse-time
  §D.2.35.4 conformance checks reject `num_packed_regions == 0`
  (`RegionWisePackingNoRegions`), a zero `proj_picture_*`
  (`RegionWisePackingProjPictureZero`) or `packed_picture_*`
  (`RegionWisePackingPackedPictureZero`) dimension, and a guard band
  with all four dimensions zero (`RegionWisePackingGuardBandAllZero`).
  Wired into `parse_payload(155, …)` →
  `SeiPayload::RegionWisePacking`. Nine unit tests cover the cancel
  path, a single region without a guard band, a region with a
  four-edge guard band, a two-region mixed-guard-band message, the
  four §D.2.35.4 error paths, and parse_payload dispatch.

- **sei: round-110 — dec_ref_pic_marking_repetition Annex D SEI payload
  (type 7).** Adds `dec_ref_pic_marking_repetition` (§D.1.9 / §D.2.9 of
  `docs/video/h264/T-REC-H.264-202408-I.pdf`), bringing the typed-SEI
  surface from 35 to 36 recognised payloads. The message repeats the
  `dec_ref_pic_marking()` syntax structure (§7.3.3.3) that originally
  appeared in an earlier picture's slice header(s), so a decoder that
  lost that picture can still apply its reference-marking operations.
  New `parse_dec_ref_pic_marking_repetition` reads `original_idr_flag
  u(1)`, `original_frame_num ue(v)`, and — only when the active SPS has
  `frame_mbs_only_flag == 0` — `original_field_pic_flag u(1)` plus
  (when set) `original_bottom_field_flag u(1)`, then the embedded
  `dec_ref_pic_marking()`. Per §D.2.9 the `IdrPicFlag` selecting the
  embedded structure's IDR vs. non-IDR branch is `original_idr_flag`,
  not the SEI NAL's own flag: the IDR branch yields
  `no_output_of_prior_pics_flag` + `long_term_reference_flag`, the
  non-IDR branch the `adaptive_ref_pic_marking_mode_flag` sliding-window
  / MMCO loop. The embedded reader reuses the shared
  `slice_header::{DecRefPicMarking, MmcoOp}` data model and validates
  `memory_management_control_operation` to 0..=6 per Table 7-9
  (`SeiError::DecRefPicMarkingRepetitionMmcoOutOfRange`). The active
  SPS `frame_mbs_only_flag` is newly carried on
  `SeiContext::frame_mbs_only_flag` (default `true`). Wired into
  `parse_payload(7, …)` → `SeiPayload::DecRefPicMarkingRepetition`.
  Eight unit tests cover the IDR frame-only path, a two-op adaptive
  MMCO loop, sliding-window, field coding with and without a bottom-
  field flag, an all-six-MMCO-ops sweep, the out-of-range MMCO error,
  and parse_payload dispatch.

- **sei: round-107 — content_colour_volume Annex D SEI payload (type 149).**
  Adds `content_colour_volume` (§D.1.33 / §D.2.33 of
  `docs/video/h264/T-REC-H.264-202408-I.pdf`), bringing the typed-SEI
  surface from 34 to 35 recognised payloads. The message records the
  colour volume (display gamut + luminance range) actually present in
  the content, complementing the mastering-display volume (type 137)
  and MaxCLL/MaxFALL (type 144). New `parse_content_colour_volume`
  reads `ccv_cancel_flag u(1)`; when not cancelled it reads
  `ccv_persistence_flag u(1)` + the four present flags
  (`ccv_primaries_present_flag`, `ccv_min_/max_/avg_luminance_value_
  present_flag`, each `u(1)`) + `ccv_reserved_zero_2bits u(2)` (read
  and ignored per §D.2.33), then the gated sub-blocks: three
  `(ccv_primaries_x[c], ccv_primaries_y[c])` `i(32)` pairs (green /
  blue / red ordering per §D.2.33), and `ccv_min_/max_/avg_luminance_
  value u(32)`. Parse-time §D.2.33 conformance checks reject the
  all-present-flags-zero case (`ContentColourVolumeNoComponents`),
  primary coordinates outside [-5 000 000, 5 000 000]
  (`ContentColourVolumePrimaryOutOfRange`), and any luminance-ordering
  violation among the present values — `min <= avg`, `avg <= max`,
  `min <= max` (`ContentColourVolumeLuminanceOrder`). Wired into
  `parse_payload(149, …)` → `SeiPayload::ContentColourVolume`. Ten
  unit tests cover the cancel path, an all-fields BT.2020-style
  message, a single-luminance-only body, negative primary coordinates
  round-tripping through `i(32)`, and the four §D.2.33 error paths.

- **sei: round-103 — spare_pic Annex D SEI payload (type 8).**
  Adds `spare_pic` (§D.1.10 / §D.2.10 of
  `docs/video/h264/T-REC-H.264-202408-I.pdf`), bringing the typed-SEI
  surface from 33 to 34 recognised payloads. The message flags
  slice-group map units of one or more decoded reference pictures (the
  spare pictures) as resembling the co-located map units of a target
  picture, so an error-concealing decoder can substitute spare-picture
  samples. New `parse_spare_pic` reads `target_frame_num ue(v)`,
  `spare_field_flag u(1)` (+ optional `target_bottom_field_flag`),
  `num_spare_pics_minus1 ue(v)` (validated to 0..=15 per §D.2.10), then
  one `SparePicEntry` per spare picture: `delta_spare_frame_num ue(v)`,
  optional `spare_bottom_field_flag` (field messages only), and
  `spare_area_idc ue(v)` (validated to 0..=2) selecting the spare-area
  coding — `0` = whole picture spare (no per-unit data), `1` = one
  `spare_unit_flag u(1)` per map unit in raster order (stored as
  `true` = spare per §D.2.10), `2` = `zero_run_length ue(v)` runs in
  counter-clockwise box-out order read until the running map-unit count
  reaches `PicSizeInMapUnits`. The `1`/`2` branches need
  `PicSizeInMapUnits`, newly carried on `SeiContext::pic_size_in_map_units`
  (default 0; a message reaching a per-unit branch with 0 is rejected
  with `SeiError::SparePicMapUnitsUnknown` rather than guessed). Wired
  into `parse_payload(8, …)` → `SeiPayload::SparePic`. Nine unit tests
  cover all three `spare_area_idc` methods, a field message with bottom
  -field flags, a two-entry mixed-method message, and the three range/
  context error paths.

- **sei: round-99 — sub-sequence Annex D SEI payload family (2003 draft).**
  Three new payload types land, bringing the typed-SEI surface from
  30 to 33 recognised payloads. All three are specified in the 2003
  draft (`docs/video/h264/ISO_IEC_14496-10-AVC-2003-draft.pdf`,
  §D.1.11–§D.1.13 / §D.2.11–§D.2.13) and describe the sub-sequence
  data-dependency hierarchy (layer 0 independently decodable, higher
  layers predicted only from lower ones):
  - **10** `sub_seq_info` (§D.1.11 / §D.2.11) — places the current
    picture in the hierarchy: `sub_seq_layer_num ue(v)` (< 256) +
    `sub_seq_id ue(v)` (< 65536) + `first_ref_pic_flag` +
    `leading_non_ref_pic_flag` + `last_pic_flag` +
    `sub_seq_frame_num_flag`, the optional `sub_seq_frame_num ue(v)`
    counting pictures within the sub-sequence modulo `MaxFrameNum`.
  - **11** `sub_seq_layer_characteristics` (§D.1.12 / §D.2.12) —
    `num_sub_seq_layers_minus1 ue(v)` (≤ 255) followed by one
    `(accurate_statistics_flag u(1), average_bit_rate u(16),
    average_frame_rate u(16))` triple per layer; the layer-`N` entry
    jointly characterises layers `0..=N`.
  - **12** `sub_seq_characteristics` (§D.1.13 / §D.2.13) — target
    `sub_seq_layer_num` / `sub_seq_id`, optional `sub_seq_duration
    u(32)` (90-kHz ticks) gated on `duration_flag`, an optional
    average-rate triple gated on `average_rate_flag`, and a list of
    `num_referenced_subseqs ue(v)` (< 256) inter-prediction-reference
    sub-sequences `(ref_sub_seq_layer_num, ref_sub_seq_id,
    ref_sub_seq_direction)`.
  Parse-time §D.2.11–§D.2.13 range checks reject out-of-range
  `sub_seq_layer_num` / `sub_seq_id` / `num_sub_seq_layers_minus1` /
  `num_referenced_subseqs`. Nine new unit tests cover both the
  with/without optional-field branches and the dispatch wiring for
  payload types 10/11/12.

- **sei: round-95 — two additional Annex D SEI payload parsers.**
  Two new payload types land, bringing the typed-SEI surface from
  28 to 30 recognised payloads:
  - **156** `omni_viewport` (§D.1.35.5 / §D.2.35.5) — completes
    the 360-video SEI family started in round 78 (alongside
    `equirectangular_projection` (150), `cubemap_projection`
    (151), and `sphere_rotation` (154)). `omni_viewport_id u(10)`
    + `omni_viewport_cancel_flag u(1)` + (when not cancelled)
    `omni_viewport_persistence_flag u(1)` + `omni_viewport_cnt_minus1
    u(4)` + the per-viewport quintuple `(azimuth_centre i(32),
    elevation_centre i(32), tilt_centre i(32), hor_range u(32),
    ver_range u(32))`. Parse-time §D.2.35.5 range checks enforce:
    `azimuth_centre`, `tilt_centre` ∈ [−180·2^16, 180·2^16 − 1];
    `elevation_centre` ∈ [−90·2^16, 90·2^16]; `hor_range` ∈
    [1, 360·2^16]; `ver_range` ∈ [1, 180·2^16].
  - **205** `shutter_interval_info` (§D.1.38 / §D.2.38) — indicates
    the camera shutter interval (image-sensor exposure time) for
    the associated source pictures, either as a single CVS-wide
    constant or as a per-sub-layer schedule. `sii_sub_layer_idx
    ue(v)` gates the body; when the index is 0 the body adds
    `shutter_interval_info_present_flag u(1)` and (when the
    present-flag is 1) `sii_time_scale u(32)` +
    `fixed_shutter_interval_within_cvs_flag u(1)` + either
    `sii_num_units_in_shutter_interval u(32)` (fixed-mode) or
    `sii_max_sub_layers_minus1 u(3)` followed by
    `sub_layer_num_units_in_shutter_interval[i] u(32)`
    (per-sub-layer). Parse-time §D.2.38 range check enforces
    `sii_time_scale > 0`. The shutter interval, in seconds, is
    derivable as `num_units / time_scale` (e.g. the §D.2.38
    worked example: 27 MHz time-scale + 1_080_000 units →
    0.04 s).

  Each new parser ships unit tests (16 new: 9 for omni_viewport
  covering cancel / single director's-cut / two-entry / max-range
  boundary plus four range-rejection paths and a parse_payload
  dispatch; 7 for shutter_interval_info covering present-false /
  non-zero sub-layer-idx / fixed 27 MHz worked example /
  per-sub-layer schedule / time_scale=0 reject and a parse_payload
  dispatch). Six new `SeiError` variants police the §D.2.35.5
  / §D.2.38 range checks. The SEI table header comment in
  `src/sei.rs` is updated; coverage bumps from 28 → 30 recognised
  SEI types.

### Fixed

- **h264_decoder: drop in-progress pictures whose MbGrid is
  incomplete at finalize time (round 91 fuzz-oracle triage,
  third hardening).** Per §7.4.2.1 / Annex A, a coded picture's
  slices shall collectively cover macroblock addresses
  `0..PicSizeInMbs`. Previously we emitted any picture for which
  at least one slice succeeded (`any_slice_succeeded` gate) even
  when the slice walk stopped well short of the picture's last
  MB — the un-walked tail came out zero. A 420 B fuzz crash
  (`crash-b20f4127…`) hit this on a 48x2048 (PicSizeInMbs = 384)
  picture whose two slices each walked ~4 MBs before
  `end_of_slice_flag` or a CABAC failure; we emitted two
  mostly-zero `Frame::Video`, libavcodec emitted none. The fix
  scans `MbGrid::info[]` for any `available == false` entry at
  finalize time and drops the in-progress picture when found
  (the `MbInfo::available` flag was already set per-MB by
  `reconstruct_slice_no_deblock`).
- **sps: reject `frame_cropping` offsets that overshoot the coded
  picture (round 91 fuzz-oracle triage, follow-up).** Per §7.4.2.1.1
  the cropping rectangle must satisfy
  `frame_crop_left_offset ≤ (PicWidthInSamplesL / CropUnitX) − (frame_crop_right_offset + 1)`
  and the mirror inequality on the vertical axis. Previously our
  SPS parser accepted any `ue(v)`-decoded offsets without checking
  against the picture extent; a 506 B input
  (`crash-8e8b38ae…`) carried `frame_crop_top_offset = 2148` against
  a `FrameHeightInSamplesL = 16` picture, so `CropUnitY * (top +
  bottom + 1) = 2 * 2151 = 4302 > 16` — but the SPS still activated,
  slices reconstructed against MB 0 OK, and we emitted two
  `Frame::Video` while libavcodec rejected the SPS outright with
  "crop values invalid 0 5 2148 2 / 2848 16". The fix derives
  CropUnitX / CropUnitY per §7.4.2.1.1 eqs. 7-19..7-22 (4:2:0 / 4:2:2
  / 4:4:4 SubWidthC × SubHeightC table, mbs_only_flag scaling) and
  raises `SpsError::FrameCroppingOutOfRange` when either inequality
  fails. Two new unit tests pin the boundary (max-allowed offsets
  accepted) and the reject path (overshoot rejected); a third
  integration test
  `fuzz_crash_8e8b38ae_sps_crop_out_of_range_rejected` embeds the
  506 B crash verbatim.
- **slice_header: reject `first_mb_in_slice != 0` when opening a new
  coded picture (round 91 fuzz-oracle triage).** Per §7.4.3 + Annex A
  the first VCL slice of a coded picture must cover MB 0 when
  arbitrary slice order (ASO) is not allowed; ASO is gated on the
  same Baseline/Extended-with-FMO carve-out we already reject at PPS
  activation (`DecoderError::FmoNotSupported` — see `decoder.rs`).
  Previously, an input whose every "first" slice carried
  `first_mb_in_slice > 0` opened a fresh `PictureInProgress` whose
  MBs `0..first_mb_in_slice` were never coded; the slice walk did
  return Ok (it just covered the wrong MBs), so
  `any_slice_succeeded` flipped to true and `finalize_in_progress_picture`
  emitted a `Frame::Video` whose luma + chroma planes were the
  zero-initialised allocation buffer. libavcodec rejects the access
  unit outright; we now match. Caught by `ffmpeg_oracle_decode` on
  `crash-957ac808…` (440 B, four IDR slices, all with
  `first_mb_in_slice == 2`, 1×6-MB picture). New regression test
  `fuzz_crash_957ac808_first_mb_nonzero_for_new_picture_rejected`
  pins the libavcodec parity.

### Added

- **sei: round-78 — four additional Annex D HDR + 360 payload parsers.**
  The decoder now recognises four more SEI payload types it previously
  kept as `SeiPayload::Unknown`:
  - **148** `ambient_viewing_environment` (§D.1.34 / §D.2.34) —
    `ambient_illuminance` (`u(32)`, nonzero per §D.2.34) +
    `ambient_light_x` / `ambient_light_y` (`u(16)` each, 0..=50000 per
    §D.2.34 CIE 1931 chromaticity scaled by 50000). Parse-time range
    check rejects illuminance=0 and chromaticity > 50000.
  - **150** `equirectangular_projection` (§D.1.35.1 / §D.2.35.1) —
    `erp_cancel_flag` + (when not cancelled) `erp_persistence_flag` +
    `erp_padding_flag` + `erp_reserved_zero_2bits` (consumed but
    ignored per §D.2.35.1) + the §D.1.35.1 padding-conditional triple
    (`gb_erp_type u(3)`, `left_gb_erp_width u(8)`,
    `right_gb_erp_width u(8)`).
  - **151** `cubemap_projection` (§D.1.35.2 / §D.2.35.2) — the
    shortest body in the family: `cmp_cancel_flag u(1)` plus, when
    not cancelled, `cmp_persistence_flag u(1)`.
  - **154** `sphere_rotation` (§D.1.35.3 / §D.2.35.3) —
    `sphere_rotation_cancel_flag` + (when not cancelled) the
    `sphere_rotation_persistence_flag u(1)`, `reserved_zero_6bits
    u(6)` (consumed but ignored), and three `i(32)` rotation
    angles (yaw, pitch, roll). Parse-time §D.2.35.3 range checks
    enforce yaw / roll ∈ [−180·2^16, 180·2^16 − 1] and pitch ∈
    [−90·2^16, 90·2^16].

  Each new parser ships unit tests (15 new) exercising both
  `parse_*` directly and the `parse_payload` dispatcher for the
  matching `payload_type`. Six new `SeiError` variants police the
  §D.2.34 / §D.2.35.3 range checks. Coverage bumps from 24 → 28
  recognised SEI types; the SEI table header comment in
  `src/sei.rs` is updated.

- **sei: round-73 — five additional Annex D payload parsers.** The
  decoder now recognises five SEI payload types it previously kept as
  `SeiPayload::Unknown`:
  - **9** `scene_info` (§D.1.11 / §D.2.11) — `scene_id` +
    `scene_transition_type` with the §D.1.11 `> 3` branch reading
    `second_scene_id`.
  - **16** `progressive_refinement_segment_start` (§D.1.18 / §D.2.18)
    — `progressive_refinement_id` + `num_refinement_steps_minus1`.
  - **17** `progressive_refinement_segment_end` (§D.1.19 / §D.2.19)
    — pairs with type 16 by `progressive_refinement_id`.
  - **18** `motion_constrained_slice_group_set` (§D.1.20 / §D.2.20)
    — variable-width `slice_group_id[i]` (`u(v)` with
    `v = Ceil(Log2(num_slice_groups))`) drawn from the active PPS via
    a new `SeiContext::num_slice_groups` field; collapses to 0 bits
    when `num_slice_groups <= 1`, with optional `pan_scan_rect_id`.
  - **21** `stereo_video_info` (§D.1.23 / §D.2.23) — both
    `field_views_flag = 1` (top_field_is_left_view_flag) and the
    frame-views branch (`current_frame_is_left_view_flag` +
    `next_frame_is_second_view_flag`) plus the two
    `*_self_contained_flag` bits.

  Each new parser ships unit tests in `sei::tests` (12 new tests)
  exercising both `parse_*` directly and the `parse_payload`
  dispatcher for the corresponding `payload_type`. `SeiContext` loses
  its derived `Default` for a manual impl so the new
  `num_slice_groups` field defaults to `1`. Coverage bumps from
  19 → 24 recognised SEI types; the SEI table header comment in
  `src/sei.rs` is updated to list all 24.

- **encoder: CABAC inter trellis quantisation (round 49 — Lever C
  RDOQ-lite).** A new `EncoderConfig::trellis_quant` toggle (default
  `true`) wires a single-pass greedy Viterbi over the open-loop
  quantised levels in the P-CABAC + B-CABAC inter luma paths.
  `crate::encoder::transform::trellis_refine_4x4_ac` revisits each
  non-zero quantised coefficient at each scan position and considers
  one alternative (`|level|` → `|level| − 1` toward zero); the
  alternative is accepted iff the spatial-domain `D + λ·R` cost
  strictly drops, where the rate term is approximated from §9.3.3.1.3
  (significant_coeff_flag + last_significant_coeff_flag + truncated-
  unary prefix + sign), λ follows the JM `0.85 · 2^((QP-12)/3) · 2/3`
  RDOQ relaxation, and D is the SSD between source and reconstructed
  residual after the actual §8.5.12 inverse transform. The refinement
  is informative — the decoder is unchanged, the bitstream syntax is
  identical — so existing fixtures pin bit-equivalent ffmpeg cross-
  decode (max diff 0) with the trellis enabled. On a 64×64 textured-
  motion P-slice at QP=22 the encoded length drops from 178 → 167
  bytes (-6.2 %) while local-recon PSNR_Y moves from 45.10 → 44.94
  dB (-0.16 dB, well inside quantisation noise); the new
  `integration_trellis_quant.rs` pins this number plus a QP=18..38
  sweep that asserts the trellis never enlarges the inter slice.
  Spec basis: §9.3.3.1.3 (CABAC residual binarisation), §8.5.12
  (inverse 4×4 transform), informative reference JVT-D015. No
  external encoder source consulted.

### Fixed

- **sps: bound `max_num_ref_frames` at 16 (§7.4.2.1.1 / Annex A.3.1).**
  The spec says `max_num_ref_frames` shall be in the range `0..MaxDpbFrames`
  where MaxDpbFrames = `Min(MaxDpbMbs / (PicWidthInMbs * FrameHeightInMbs), 16)`.
  The cap at 16 is absolute — independent of level — and any value above
  it implies a malformed bitstream that libavcodec rejects with
  "too many reference frames". Closes a fuzz-oracle strictness divergence
  on `crash-f9387b9697e640efbd689a9909ff59deaaf32864`, where a stream
  with `max_num_ref_frames=32` was accepted by oxideav-h264 (producing
  partially-decoded pictures from the slices that survived MB-level
  CABAC parse) while libavcodec rejected the SPS outright.
- **reconstruct + inter_pred: reject inter MC against zero-dim
  reference (§8.4.2).** §8.4.2 motion compensation addresses reference
  samples via `Clip3(0, src_width-1, x)` / `Clip3(0, src_height-1, y)`.
  With `src_width` or `src_height == 0` the clip range becomes
  `[0, -1]` (lo > hi), and our `clip3` implementation returns
  `hi == -1`. `-1 as usize == usize::MAX` then indexes the empty
  `ref_pic.cb` slice and panics. A malformed bitstream whose active
  reference list resolves to an uninitialised DPB slot (chroma
  monochrome / placeholder) triggers this in the slow edge-replicated
  path of `interpolate_chroma`. New `ReconstructError::InvalidRefDims`
  guards both `mc_luma_partition` (luma dims) and `mc_chroma_partition`
  (chroma dims) at the MC entry. New `InterPredError::ZeroDimRef`
  guards `interpolate_luma` / `interpolate_chroma` in `inter_pred`,
  `simd::chunked` (and via delegation `simd::scalar`, `simd::portable`)
  for defence-in-depth. Regression for fuzz crash
  `crash-a6f950699905bc0f4d353474b94d4801044c8091`.
- **slice_header: bound `first_mb_in_slice` by PicSizeInMbs
  (§7.4.3).** The spec constrains `first_mb_in_slice` to
  `0..PicSizeInMbs - 1` (non-MBAFF) or `0..PicSizeInMbs/2 - 1` (MBAFF,
  where the parsed value is in macroblock-pair units and the underlying
  raw MB address is `first_mb_in_slice * 2`). With no upper bound
  applied at parse time, a multi-million MB address propagated to
  `reconstruct::mb_sample_origin`, where the `(mb_addr / PicWidthInMbs)
  * 16` i32 multiply overflowed in debug / sanitizer builds. New
  `SliceHeaderError::FirstMbInSliceOutOfRange` carries the parsed
  value + max + PicSizeInMbs + mbaff flag for diagnostics. PicSizeInMbs
  is derived per eq. (7-31) `= PicWidthInMbs * PicHeightInMbs` with
  PicHeightInMbs = FrameHeightInMbs / (1 + field_pic_flag) per eq.
  (7-28), so the check runs after `field_pic_flag` is parsed.
  Regression for fuzz crash
  `crash-80e231ea0edb920c618dc6ea3f9d04626a5b2b16` (175-byte input
  triggering the i32 multiply overflow path through `reconstruct.rs:254`).
- **h264_decoder: drop in-progress picture when every slice failed
  parse / reconstruction (§7.4.1.2.4).** `H264CodecDecoder` collects
  per-slice CABAC/CAVLC failures via an `eprintln!` log line and
  keeps assembling the in-progress picture; the previous behaviour
  then ran §8.7 deblocking on the never-painted picture and pushed
  it through the §C.4 output bumping process, so `receive_frame`
  emitted a zeroed `Frame::Video` for an access unit whose every
  slice was malformed. libavcodec rejects the access unit outright
  in that case (no frame produced), which the fuzz oracle flagged
  as a strictness divergence on a 175-byte input
  (`crash-2ad9589faea57c09b55364bf7ac4af0373e66c18`: PPS + SPS +
  three non-IDR slices, every slice's CABAC stream runs past EOF).
  `PictureInProgress` now carries an `any_slice_succeeded` flag set
  on the OK return of `reconstruct_slice_into_in_progress`; finalize
  drops the picture (no DPB insert, no `VideoFrame` emit) when the
  flag is still false. Multi-slice pictures where some slices
  succeed and others fail are unchanged — the partially-painted
  picture still finalizes, matching the existing best-effort
  recovery for the JVT SVA_Base_B / SL1_SVA_B conformance streams.
- **sps: reject reserved profile_idc values (§A.1 / §A.2).** Only the
  16 profile_idc values enumerated in clause A.2 (66, 77, 88, 100,
  110, 122, 244, 44, 83, 86, 118, 128, 138, 139, 134, 135) are
  defined; §A.1 says "all other values of profile_idc and level_idc
  are reserved for future use". `Sps::parse` now returns
  `SpsError::ProfileIdcReserved` for any other value, matching
  libavcodec's "sps_id 0 out of range" rejection of fuzz inputs
  carrying profile_idc=243 / 251 (regression for fuzz crash
  `crash-1b2aaf6f54f92df08bf67802c970555c02de3b4e`).
- **transform: use wrapping arithmetic in §8.5.11.1 / §8.5.11.2
  chroma DC Hadamard + scaling for both 4:2:0 and 4:2:2.** Same
  class of bug as commit `dc09485` (4x4 / 8x8 transforms): a
  malformed CAVLC/CABAC stream can carry residual coefficients near
  i32::MAX, the Hadamard combine sums up to 4 of them, and `f * ls
  << shift` then panicked on debug builds with "attempt to shift
  left with overflow" (regression for fuzz crash
  `crash-5e4c895f03eb99238772ecd84738327f07b4cf75`). Wrapping
  arithmetic absorbs the overflow; the §8.5.13 Clip3 stage in
  reconstruct clamps wrapped pixels back to bit-depth range.
- **decoder: reject FMO PPS activation (§A.2).** A slice that
  activates a PPS with `num_slice_groups_minus1 > 0` (Flexible
  Macroblock Ordering) is now rejected with
  `DecoderError::FmoNotSupported`. Per §A.2.1 / §A.2.3, FMO is
  constrained to the Baseline (profile_idc=66) and Extended
  (profile_idc=88) profiles, and our §8.4 reconstruction path walks
  raster (slice-group-0) order — it does not honour the §8.2.2
  MbToSliceGroupMap. Without this gate the decoder emitted a
  silently-mis-decoded picture for FMO streams that the H.264
  reference decoder (libavcodec) refuses outright with "FMO is not
  implemented", which the fuzz oracle flagged as a strictness
  divergence (`crash-181e9dea7dfa8fcb2c9721a3f9f044214af6167b`).
- **transform: use wrapping arithmetic in §8.5.12 / §8.5.13
  inverse-quant multiplications.** Spec-conformant streams keep `c *
  ls` in i32; only malformed input could drive the product past
  i32::MAX (panic: multiply with overflow). The downstream §8.5.13
  Clip3 stage clamps everything back into bit-depth range, so
  silently wrapping bad input is preferable to panicking on it.
- **cavlc: tighten `level_prefix` cap from 32 to 25 (§9.2.2 note).**
  The spec mandates `level_prefix ≤ 25`. The previous cap of 32 let
  malformed CAVLC streams synthesise `levelCode` values whose
  downstream §8.5.12 multiplication overflowed.
- **cabac: tighten UEG0 escape suffix cap from k=30 to k=14
  (§7.4.5.3.2).** Real coefficients fit in 16 bits; the previous
  k=30 cap let malformed streams produce `coeff_abs_level_minus1`
  values up to ~2^31, which then panicked in the §8.5.12 inverse
  quant multiplication. Cap aligns with the actual spec residual
  range.
- **slice_data: bound `mb_skip_run` and the macroblock walker against
  malformed streams.** §7.4.4 implicitly bounds `mb_skip_run` by
  `PicSizeInMbs - CurrMbAddr`, but the parser used to accept any
  ue(v) and grew the `macroblocks` Vec until the process OOM'd
  (~2.7 GB realloc reachable in CAVLC). A hard cap of 2^18 MBs (well
  above any Annex A level) on both `mb_skip_run` and `CurrMbAddr`
  rejects pathological streams with `SliceDataError::MbSkipRunOverflow`
  / `MbAddrOverflow` instead of panicking.
- **slice_header: cap `num_ref_idx_lX_active_minus1` at 63.** §7.4.3
  bounds the field at 31 (frame) / 63 (field); without enforcement an
  oversized value funneled into `parse_pred_weight_table` /
  `parse_ref_pic_list_modification` and drove a multi-gigabyte
  allocation. Defensive re-check covers PPS-inherited defaults too.
- **pps: cap `pic_size_in_map_units_minus1` (FMO type 6) at 2^22 − 2.**
  Previously fed unbounded into `Vec::with_capacity`, exposing a
  decoder-side OOM via a single PPS NAL (~3.2 GB realloc reachable).
- **cabac: bound the bypass Exp-Golomb escape suffix at `k = 30`.**
  Both `coeff_abs_level_minus1` (UEG0, §9.3.3.1.3) and `mvd_lX`
  (UEG3, §9.3.3.1.1.7) accumulated `k` without limit before computing
  `1u32 << k`, panicking with `attempt to shift left with overflow`
  in CABAC residual decode for any stream that fed ≥ 32 leading-one
  bins in a row. Now returns `CabacError::EgEscapeSuffixOverflow`.
- **scaling_list: enforce §7.4.2.1.1.1 `delta_scale ∈ −128..=127`
  bound.** Previously the parser quietly accepted any se(v) value and
  evaluated `last_scale + delta_scale + 256` in i32, which panicked
  with `attempt to add with overflow` for values fed via oversized
  se(v) codewords. Out-of-range deltas now return
  `ScalingListError::DeltaScaleOutOfRange`. Surfaced by fuzz CI run
  25642717757 once the bitstream-overflow gate landed.
- **sps: cap `pic_width_in_mbs_minus1` and
  `pic_height_in_map_units_minus1` at 510.** §A.3 level limits bound
  real streams well below this — Level 6.2 needs ~1056 mbs / axis,
  4K-class needs ~240 — but malformed inputs could previously feed
  arbitrarily large dimensions into `sps.pic_width_in_mbs() * 16`
  (panic: multiply with overflow), `pic_width_in_mbs() *
  frame_height_in_mbs()` (panic on mb_count), and `Picture::new`
  (multi-GB calloc → fuzz OOM at 7.5 GB). The chosen ceiling
  guarantees every downstream multiplication stays in u32 *and* the
  worst-case `Picture` allocation (3 × width × height at 4:4:4)
  stays under ~200 MB.
- **Exp-Golomb decoder no longer panics on 32+ leading zeros.**
  `BitReader::read_codenum` previously accepted up to 32 leading zero
  bits, then computed `1u32 << leading_zeros` — which is undefined
  behaviour in Rust at `leading_zeros == 32` and panicked with
  `attempt to shift left with overflow` in debug builds. The bound is
  now 31 (the largest `k` for which `2^k − 1 + suffix` still fits in
  u32), returning `BitError::ExpGolombOverflow` for malformed streams
  that ask for more. The crash was reachable via PPS parsing on
  fuzzer input (panic_free_decode crash
  `5c9d8c8642cdb8ffc371d3dbb45c3a1604477676`). Regression unit tests
  added in `src/bitstream.rs` cover both the overflow rejection path
  and the 31-zeros boundary that yields the largest legal codeNum.

## [0.1.4](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav-h264/compare/v0.1.3...v0.1.4) - 2026-05-06

### Other

- drop stale REGISTRARS / with_all_features intra-doc links
- drop dead `linkme` dep
- CABAC 4:4:4 IDR encode (round 33) + fix ctxIdx 460-1023 init
- registry calls: rename make_decoder/make_encoder → first_decoder/first_encoder
- auto-register via oxideav_core::register! macro (linkme distributed slice)
- unify entry point on register(&mut RuntimeContext) ([#502](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav-h264/pull/502))

### Fixed

- **CABAC context init Tables 9-25..9-33 (ctxIdx 460..=1023) added.**
  All nine missing tables — coded_block_flag, significant_coeff_flag,
  last_significant_coeff_flag, and coeff_abs_level_minus1 for 4:4:4
  chroma blockCat 6..=13 (Cb/Cr planes) plus 8x8 field/frame variants —
  were absent from `init_table()`. Every context in the 460..=1023 range
  fell back to the neutral (0,0) init (pStateIdx=62, valMPS=0), causing
  ffmpeg to fail decoding multi-MB 4:4:4 IDR CABAC streams with "top
  block unavailable for requested intra mode". All five round-33 4:4:4
  CABAC tests now pass including ffmpeg interop for 32×16 and 64×64.

## [0.1.3](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav-h264/compare/v0.1.2...v0.1.3) - 2026-05-05

### Other

- CABAC per-cell mixed B_8x8 (task #475)
- CABAC B 16x8 / 8x16 partition modes + B_8x8 all-Direct (task #475)
- CABAC real ME + B_Skip / B_Direct_16x16 (round 32)
- B-slice CABAC encode (round 31)

### Added

- **Encoder: CABAC per-cell mixed B_8x8 (task #475).** `encode_b_cabac`
  now picks per-quadrant `sub_mb_type ∈ {B_Direct_8x8, B_L0_8x8,
  B_L1_8x8, B_Bi_8x8}` for `mb_type=22` MBs, mirroring the CAVLC
  round-25 selector. Per-cell ME (`pick_best_b8x8_cell`) builds an
  L0 / L1 / Bi candidate per 8x8 quadrant and picks the lowest-
  Lagrangian-cost variant; mixed mode wins over `B_Direct_16x16` /
  `B_8x8`-all-Direct / explicit-16x16 / partition modes when its
  total cell SAD beats the current best by more than the
  +12-bit MB-header bias. Writer emits `mb_type=22` + per-cell
  `sub_mb_type` raw {0, 1, 2, 3} via `encode_sub_mb_type_b`, then
  per-cell mvd_l0[i] (cell order 0..3) + mvd_l1[i] (cell order 0..3)
  per §7.3.5.2 sub_mb_pred() field ordering.

  New `cabac_mvp_for_b_8x8_partition` derives §8.4.1.3 mvp for one
  8x8 sub-MB partition with `MvpredShape::Default` (no directional
  shortcut for 8x8 cells) using a per-cell inflight tracker
  `cabac_neighbour_partition_mv_b8x8` that distinguishes
  "cell decoded but list X unused" (returns `intra_but_mb_available`,
  partition_available=true) from "cell not yet decoded" (returns
  `partition_not_yet_decoded_same_mb`, partition_available=false) —
  the distinction matters for the §8.4.1.3.2 C→D substitution gate.
  Per-cell inflight is updated in raster order, mirroring the
  decoder's per-cell `process_partition` grid update; Direct cells
  contribute their §8.4.1.2.2-derived MVs / refs to the inflight even
  though they emit no mvd. The L1 mvd loop walks raster order with a
  fresh per-cell inflight to re-mirror the decoder's
  cells-0..(c-1)-only state at cell c's L1 mvp derivation point.

  Predictor build stitches per-cell 8x8 luma + 4x4 chroma predictors
  via `build_b_explicit_8x8_cell_luma` /
  `build_b_explicit_4x4_cell_chroma` (now `pub(crate)`); Direct
  cells build per-cell predictors from `direct.mv_l0_per_8x8[c]` /
  `direct.mv_l1_per_8x8[c]` directly (independent of the
  `direct_8x8_competitive` build, which only fires when
  `!direct_uniform`). Per-MB grid update writes per-cell `ref_idx_l*`
  + `mv_l*` + `abs_mvd_l*` so neighbour MBs reading our slot get the
  right §8.4.1.3 / §9.3.3.1.1.7 inputs. Per-4x4 deblock state
  (`MbDeblockInfo.mv_l*` / `ref_idx_l*` / `ref_poc_l*`) reflects the
  per-cell layout so the §8.7.2.1 bS derivation matches the decoder.

  ffmpeg cross-decode bit-exact (max diff 0) on the round-25 mixed-
  motion fixture (32×16 px, IDR + P + B, per-quadrant content
  offsets exercising all four cell kinds) at PSNR_Y = 44.20 dB.
  B-slice shrinks 99 → 73 bytes (~26 %) on the 64×64 round-475
  per-half-motion fixture vs the prior partition-only path. Encoder
  exits at ~72 % H.264 syntax coverage estimated by the task
  yardstick.

- **Encoder: CABAC B 16x8 / 8x16 partition modes + B_8x8 all-Direct
  (task #475).** `encode_b_cabac` now emits Table 7-14 mb_type ∈ 4..=21
  (the nine 16x8 + nine 8x16 partition variants) by mirroring the CAVLC
  partition-decision pipeline: per-cell `search_quarter_pel_8x8` ME on
  each list × four 8x8 cells, per-partition `best_partition_mode_b`
  pick across {L0, L1, Bi}, Lagrangian SAD compare against the 16x16
  candidates, and stitched composite predictor via the existing
  `build_b_partition_pred_luma_16x8` / `_8x16` (now `pub(crate)`).
  Per-partition mvd emission follows §7.3.5.1 ordering with within-MB
  inflight tracking for partition 1's MVP. New `cabac_enc_mvd_abs_sum`
  helper mirrors the decoder's `cabac_mvd_abs_sum` byte-for-byte so
  the §9.3.3.1.1.7 ctxIdxInc lands on the same context regardless of
  partition shape; `cabac_mvp_for_b_16x8_partition` /
  `cabac_mvp_for_b_8x16_partition` reuse the shared
  `derive_mvpred_with_d` machinery with the directional shortcuts
  (`Partition16x8Top` / `Bottom`, `Partition8x16Left` / `Right`). The
  per-MB deblock state (`MbDeblockInfo.mv_l0` / `mv_l1` / `ref_idx_*` /
  `ref_poc_*`) is now built per-4x4 from the partition layout so the
  internal partition boundary's bS derivation matches what the decoder
  computes (without this the decode/encode recon drifts ~2 LSB at the
  partition seam).

  Also adds **B_8x8 + 4× B_Direct_8x8** (mb_type=22) as a fallback
  whenever the §8.4.1.2.2 spatial-direct derivation produces non-uniform
  per-8x8 MVs: composite predictor stitched per 8x8 quadrant via
  `build_inter_pred_luma_8x8` / `build_inter_pred_chroma_4x4` (now
  `pub(crate)`); writer emits `mb_type=22` + 4× `sub_mb_type=0` (no
  ref_idx / mvd, decoder re-derives all four (mvL0, mvL1, refIdxL0,
  refIdxL1) per §8.4.1.2.2). New `encode_sub_mb_type_p` /
  `encode_sub_mb_type_b` helpers in `cabac_syntax.rs` mirror Table 9-37
  / 9-38 binarisations bin-for-bin against `decode_sub_mb_type_p` /
  `_b`. Per-cell mixed B_8x8 (per-quadrant L0 / L1 / Bi) deferred —
  the all-Direct path establishes the syntax scaffolding for the next
  round.

  ffmpeg cross-decode bit-exact (≤ 1 LSB) on per-half-motion fixtures
  forcing B_L0_L1_16x8 / B_L0_L1_8x16 (PSNR_Y ≥ 38 dB) and on the
  bipred-on-midpoint fixture exercising B_8x8 + all-Direct. Encoder
  now exits at ~62 → ~70 % H.264 syntax coverage estimated by the
  task's progress yardstick.

- **Encoder: CABAC real ME + `B_Skip` / `B_Direct_16x16` (round 32).**
  P/B CABAC paths replace the round-30/31 forced MV=(0, 0) with real
  quarter-pel motion estimation (`search_quarter_pel_16x16`) and emit
  proper §8.4.1.3 mvds against a median MV predictor. New
  `cabac_mvp_for_16x16` / `cabac_p_skip_mv` /
  `cabac_b_spatial_direct_derive` helpers track per-8x8 MVs / refIdxs
  in `CabacEncMbInfo` (`mv_l0_8x8` + `ref_idx_l0_8x8` + L1 mirrors) and
  read the §6.4.11.7 (A, B, C, D) neighbour cells through the existing
  `derive_mvpred_with_d` / `derive_p_skip_mv_with_d` /
  `derive_b_spatial_direct_with_d` infrastructure. P-CABAC now requires
  `chosen_mv == skip_mv` for P_Skip eligibility (no longer trivially
  always-skip). B-CABAC additionally implements `B_Skip` (mb_skip_flag
  with no further MB syntax) and `B_Direct_16x16` (mb_type=0 with no
  mvd / ref_idx); the §8.4.1.2.2 derivation is mirrored encoder-side
  and the direct candidate is picked over the explicit-inter rows
  (B_L0/L1/Bi_16x16) on a Lagrangian rate-bias-adjusted SAD. Per-8x8 /
  mixed `B_8x8`+all-Direct CABAC variants + 4:2:2 / 4:4:4 P/B still
  deferred. ffmpeg cross-decode bit-exact at QP 22 on translation-
  motion fixtures (PSNR_Y ≈ 99 dB on flat-object content,
  ≥ 46 dB on textured-background motion via
  `round32_b_cabac_textured_motion_ffmpeg_interop`); the smooth-content
  16-frame B-pyramid GOP shrinks from 555 → 487 bytes (~12 %) thanks
  to B_Skip / B_Direct gradually replacing the explicit B_L0_16x16
  emissions.

### Added

- **Encoder: B-slice CABAC encode (round 31).** New
  `Encoder::encode_b_cabac` entry point covering non-reference B-slices
  with CABAC entropy coding (mirror of round-30's
  `encode_idr_cabac` / `encode_p_cabac`). Per-MB pick of {`B_L0_16x16`,
  `B_L1_16x16`, `B_Bi_16x16`} on minimum-luma-SAD against MV=(0, 0)
  predictors; bipred uses the §8.4.2.3.1 default merge `(L0 + L1 + 1)
  >> 1`. New `encode_mb_type_b` syntax helper (mirror of
  `decode_mb_type_b`) covers Table 9-37 B-slice rows 0..=22 + intra
  suffix (rows 23..=48). `BSliceHeaderConfig` gains `cabac:
  Option<CabacSliceParams>` to drive `cabac_init_idc` emission per
  §7.3.3, parallel to `PSliceHeaderConfig`. Validated by
  `round31_b_cabac_self_roundtrip` (decoder ↔ encoder recon match,
  PSNR_Y ≥ 45 dB) and `round31_b_cabac_pyramid_ffmpeg_interop`
  (16-frame B-pyramid GOP — 1 IDR + 7 P + 7 B — decoded by ffmpeg with
  PSNR_Y ≈ 51.5 dB on smooth content). `B_Skip` / `B_Direct_16x16` /
  4:2:2 / 4:4:4 P/B paths still deferred. New
  `CabacEncMbInfo::is_b_skip_or_direct` field threads the spec's
  §9.3.3.1.1.3 mb_type ctxIdxOffset=27 bin-0 condTerm correctly through
  the CABAC encoder grid.

- **SEI: `full_frame_freeze` (type 13), `full_frame_freeze_release`
  (type 14), `full_frame_snapshot` (type 15), and
  `deblocking_filter_display_preference` (type 20)**, covering §D.1.15 /
  §D.1.16 / §D.1.17 / §D.1.22 and the corresponding semantics clauses.
  All four are short single-element-or-flag-gated payloads:
  * `FullFrameFreeze { full_frame_freeze_repetition_period: u32 }` —
    one ue(v) field.
  * `FullFrameFreezeRelease` — empty payload, surfaced as a unit
    `SeiPayload::FullFrameFreezeRelease` variant.
  * `FullFrameSnapshot { snapshot_id: u32 }` — one ue(v) field.
  * `DeblockingFilterDisplayPreference { cancel_flag,
    display_prior_to_deblocking_preferred_flag,
    dec_frame_buffering_constraint_flag, repetition_period }` —
    cancel-flag-gated body. When `cancel_flag` is true the body is
    absent and the other fields default to zero / false per §D.2.22.
  Wired into `parse_payload` and into `SeiPayload`. 8 new unit tests
  including dispatcher round-trips and the empty-payload release path.

- **SEI: `post_filter_hint` (payload type 22, §D.1.24 / §D.2.24)**.
  Decodes the `filter_hint_size_y` / `filter_hint_size_x` ue(v)
  dimensions, the `filter_hint_type` u(2) (0 = 2-D FIR, 1 = pair of
  1-D FIRs, 2 = cross-correlation matrix), the `filter_hint_value
  [cIdx][cy][cx]` se(v) coefficients (`3 * size_y * size_x` entries
  flattened in spec order), and the trailing
  `additional_extension_flag` u(1). Spec constraints policed:
  * `filter_hint_size_y`, `filter_hint_size_x` ∈ 1..=15 →
    `SeiError::PostFilterHintSizeOutOfRange`;
  * `filter_hint_type == 3` (reserved) →
    `SeiError::PostFilterHintTypeReserved`;
  * `filter_hint_type == 1` ⇒ `filter_hint_size_y == 2` →
    `SeiError::PostFilterHintType1WrongHeight`.
  Wired into `parse_payload` and into `SeiPayload::PostFilterHint`.
  6 new unit tests (1x1 cross-correlation round-trip, 2x3 type-0 2-D
  FIR with 18 coefficients, type=1 wrong-height rejection,
  size-out-of-range rejection, reserved-type rejection, dispatcher
  wiring).

- **SEI: `film_grain_characteristics` per-component intensity-interval body
  (§D.1.21 / §D.2.21).** Previously `parse_film_grain_characteristics`
  stopped after the three `comp_model_present_flag` bits and dropped the
  per-component (`num_intensity_intervals_minus1`,
  `num_model_values_minus1`, `intensity_interval_lower_bound`,
  `intensity_interval_upper_bound`, `comp_model_value`) data plus the
  trailing `film_grain_characteristics_repetition_period`. The full body
  is now decoded:
  * New `FilmGrainBody::components: [Option<FilmGrainComponent>; 3]`
    populated in lockstep with `comp_model_present_flag` (Y, Cb, Cr).
  * New `FilmGrainComponent { num_model_values_minus1, intensity_intervals }`
    + new `FilmGrainIntensityInterval { lower_bound, upper_bound,
    model_values: Vec<i32> }`. `comp_model_value[c][i][j]` is read as
    se(v) per the spec.
  * New `FilmGrainBody::repetition_period: u32`
    (`film_grain_characteristics_repetition_period`, ue(v)).
  * Per §D.2.21 `num_model_values_minus1[c]` shall be in 0..=5; out-of-
    range values produce
    `SeiError::FilmGrainNumModelValuesOutOfRange { component, got }`.
  * Two new round-trip tests (multi-interval / multi-model-value with
    signed `comp_model_value` entries; out-of-range rejection); the two
    pre-existing tests now extend through the new body.

- **SEI: `user_data_registered_itu_t_t35` (payload type 4) + `pan_scan_rect`
  (payload type 2)** (§D.1.4 / §D.2.4, §D.1.6 / §D.2.6). Both are
  upgraded from `SeiPayload::Unknown { payload, .. }` round-tripping
  to fully-typed payloads in the `parse_payload` dispatch.
  * `parse_user_data_registered_itu_t_t35` returns
    `(country_code, country_code_extension, payload_bytes)`. Country
    code 0xFF triggers the §D.1.6 / Recommendation ITU-T T.35 §3.1
    extension-byte read; an empty payload — or a 0xFF country code
    with no extension byte to follow — is rejected with
    `SeiError::RegisteredUserDataMissingCountryCode`. Real-world
    consumers (ATSC A/53 closed captions, AFD, ATSC bar data,
    HDR10+ dynamic metadata, Dolby Vision RPU) all ride on this
    payload, distinguished by the country / provider tuple plus the
    leading bytes of `payload_bytes`.
  * `parse_pan_scan_rect` returns `pan_scan_rect_id`, `cancel_flag`,
    and (when not cancelled) a `Vec<PanScanRectOffsets>` plus a
    `repetition_period`. The §D.2.4 `pan_scan_cnt_minus1 ∈ 0..=2`
    constraint is policed lazily — counts up to 31 are accepted but
    32+ rejected with `SeiError::PanScanCountTooLarge` to avoid
    pathological allocations on malformed streams.
  * 11 new unit tests (`registered_user_data_*` ×5, `pan_scan_rect_*`
    ×3, `parse_payload_dispatches_*` ×3) including hand-derived
    Exp-Golomb encodings of the offsets test vector.

- **Decoder honours SPS `bit_depth_luma_minus8` / `bit_depth_chroma_minus8`
  in `picture_to_video_frame`** (task #259). When a High10 / High 4:2:2
  / High 4:4:4 Predictive stream declares 9..=14-bit samples, the
  reconstructed planes are emitted as little-endian u16 (two bytes per
  sample) clamped to `(1 << bit_depth) - 1`, matching the
  `oxideav_core::PixelFormat::{Yuv420P10Le, Yuv422P10Le, Yuv444P10Le,
  Yuv420P12Le, Yuv422P12Le, Yuv444P12Le}` plane layouts. 8-bit streams
  are unchanged (one byte per sample, clamped to `0..=255`). The
  previously-`#[ignore]`d `corpus_10_bit_high10` integration test now
  runs and scores against the 16-bit-per-sample `expected.yuv`
  reference; it stays `Tier::ReportOnly` until the §8.5.10 inverse
  transform / dequant path widens to >8-bit arithmetic. Spec refs:
  §7.4.2.1.1, §6.4.2.1.

- **Round 30 — encoder CABAC entropy coding for I + P slices**.
  Adds the H.264 §9.3 CABAC arithmetic encoder (engine + per-syntax
  binarisations + ctxIdx derivation) and wires up two new entry points
  on `Encoder`: `encode_idr_cabac` and `encode_p_cabac`. PPS now carries
  `entropy_coding_mode_flag = 1` when [`EncoderConfig::cabac`] is enabled
  (Main profile or higher — Baseline forbids CABAC per §A.2.1).
  Implementation:
  * New module `encoder::cabac_engine`: §9.3.4 `EncodeDecision`,
    `EncodeBypass`, `EncodeTerminate`, `RenormE`, plus the
    carry-propagation `put_bit` / outstanding-bit mechanism. Reuses the
    decoder's `RANGE_TAB_LPS`, `TRANS_IDX_LPS`, `TRANS_IDX_MPS` tables —
    same probabilities, just walked in encode direction.
  * New module `encoder::cabac_syntax`: per-element encoders mirroring
    the decoder's `cabac_ctx::decode_*` step-for-step
    (`encode_mb_skip_flag`, `encode_mb_type_i` / `_p`,
    `encode_mvd_lx`, `encode_ref_idx_lx`, `encode_coded_block_pattern`,
    `encode_coded_block_flag`, `encode_significant_coeff_flag`,
    `encode_last_significant_coeff_flag`,
    `encode_coeff_abs_level_minus1`, `encode_coeff_sign_flag`,
    `encode_intra_chroma_pred_mode`, `encode_mb_qp_delta`,
    `encode_end_of_slice_flag`, `encode_residual_block_cabac`).
  * New module `encoder::cabac_path`: top-level IDR + P encoders
    layered on existing motion estimation / intra prediction /
    transform / quantisation primitives. IDR encodes every MB as
    Intra_16x16 with all four §8.3.3 modes trialled by SAD + chroma DC
    / V / H / Plane. P encodes P_Skip when CBP collapses to zero or
    P_L0_16x16 (single-ref, MV pinned to 0 for round-30 to keep the
    §8.4.1.3 mvp derivation off the critical path; sufficient for the
    P_Skip-dominated round-30 fixtures).
  * `BaselinePpsConfig::entropy_coding_mode_flag`: PPS gains a CABAC
    toggle. The slice header writer (`write_p_slice_header`) gains a
    `cabac` parameter that emits `cabac_init_idc` ue(v) when present
    (P/SP/B only).
  * Per-MB CBF neighbour tracking (`CabacEncGrid` +
    `cbf_neighbour_mb_level` / `cbf_neighbour_luma_ac` /
    `cbf_neighbour_chroma_ac`) mirrors the decoder's
    `CabacNeighbourGrid` so encoder + decoder agree on every
    `coded_block_flag` ctxIdxInc derivation. Internal-to-MB neighbour
    reads consult the running CBF state of the current MB; external
    neighbour reads consult the previously-encoded MB's grid slot,
    with the §9.3.3.1.1.9 "transBlockN unavailable" rule firing on
    the cbp_luma 8x8-quadrant gate for `Luma4x4` / `Luma16x16Ac`
    block types.
  Validation:
  * 27 new unit tests in `encoder::cabac_engine` (7) and
    `encoder::cabac_syntax` (20) — every primitive round-trips through
    the decoder bin-for-bin, including LPS-runs that exercise the
    `outstanding_bits` carry path, alternating bins, mixed
    decision/bypass/terminate sequences, and pseudo-random 200-bin
    streams.
  * `tests/integration_cabac_encoder.rs` — 3 integration tests:
    `round30_idr_cabac_self_roundtrip` (47.58 dB Y on 64x64 gradient,
    max enc/dec diff = 0), `round30_idr_plus_p_cabac_self_roundtrip`
    (IDR 79 bytes + P 12 bytes, 47.58 dB Y, max enc/dec diff = 0),
    `round30_idr_cabac_ffmpeg_interop` (ffmpeg 8.1 libavcodec decodes
    bit-equivalently against encoder local recon, max diff = 0).
  Status caveats:
  * I + P slices only; B slices not yet wired to the CABAC path.
  * 4:2:0 only; 4:2:2 / 4:4:4 still CAVLC-only.
  * Round-30 P encoder forces MV = (0, 0) for every inter MB to
    sidestep the §8.4.1.3 mvp derivation. Sufficient for the round-30
    acceptance fixture (≥45 dB on synthetic gradient) since static /
    near-static content hits the P_Skip fast path; future rounds will
    wire the per-MB MV grid + spec mvp derivation for moving content.
  * I_NxN (Intra_4x4) under CABAC deferred — the IDR CABAC path emits
    every MB as Intra_16x16.

- **Round 29 — encoder intra fallback in P/B slices (Intra_16x16)**.
  When [`EncoderConfig::intra_in_inter`] is true (default), the per-MB
  RDO loop in `encode_p` and `encode_b` now compares the inter cost
  `J_inter = D_inter + λ·R_inter` against an `Intra_16x16` trial cost
  `J_intra` and installs the lower-J winner. This covers occlusion,
  scene-cut frames, and high-detail areas where motion-compensated
  prediction's residual is more expensive to code than a fresh intra
  block. Per H.264 §7.3.5 the chosen MB is emitted with the intra
  mb_type values shifted by **+5** (P-slice Table 7-13 raw mb_type ∈
  6..=29 for Intra_16x16) or **+23** (B-slice Table 7-14 raw mb_type ∈
  24..=47); the existing decoder already handles intra MBs in P/B
  slices so no decoder-side change is required.
  Implementation:
  * New writer `write_intra16x16_mb_in_inter_slice` in
    `encoder::macroblock` — identical layout to `write_intra16x16_mb`
    but with a configurable `mb_type_offset` (5 or 23).
  * New `InterMbStateSnapshot` type wraps the existing `MbStateSnapshot`
    with the inter-context-only `MvGridSlot` (and optional L1 grid for
    B-slice) plus `pending_skip` counter so the trial RDO can roll
    back the loser cleanly.
  * New methods `Encoder::encode_p_mb_with_intra_fallback` /
    `encode_b_mb_with_intra_fallback` snapshot pre-state, run the
    inter trial (existing `encode_p_mb` / `encode_b_mb`), measure
    `J_inter` from `D_inter = SSD(source, recon)` and `R_inter =
    bits_emitted` delta, snapshot post-inter state, restore pre-state,
    run the new `encode_*_mb_intra16x16` trial, measure `J_intra`,
    and install the winner.
  * Shared emit helper `Encoder::encode_intra16x16_in_inter_slice`
    runs §8.3.3 luma mode RDO + §8.3.4 chroma mode SAD, builds the
    forward + quantize + inverse pipeline, writes the MB syntax, and
    updates `recon_*` / `nc_grid` / `intra_grid`. Caller updates
    `mv_grid` (intra MB → `is_intra = true`) so subsequent inter MBs'
    §8.4.1.3.2 step-2 collapse fires (mv=0, ref=-1).
  Round-29 scope:
  * `Intra_16x16` only (no `I_NxN` / `I_PCM` fallback). The §8.3.1.2
    9-mode I_NxN path in P/B slices needs careful CAVLC nC-grid
    plumbing for the in-MB neighbour reads — deferred.
  * 4:2:0 chroma only (encode_p / encode_b are 4:2:0-only).
  * `P_Skip` / `B_Skip` fast paths still trigger normally — when the
    inter trial decides the MB is a skip, `J_inter` is essentially
    zero (no syntax + zero residual SSD) and intra never wins.
  Acceptance fixture: `integration_p_slice_intra_fallback.rs`
  encodes a 64x64 textured-wall IDR + a P-frame with a 32x32
  "occluding ball" of brand-new content. Result: P-slice **588 → 108
  bytes (81.6% smaller)** under intra fallback, ffmpeg/libavcodec
  cross-decode bit-equivalent (max diff 0), self-roundtrip bit-exact
  through our own decoder. New `EncoderConfig::intra_in_inter`
  toggle (default `true`) lets callers A/B test against the inter-
  only path. P-only / B-only fixtures from rounds 16..28 are
  unaffected (their inter cost is well below any intra trial cost).

- **Round 28 — encoder 4:4:4 chroma support (IDR Intra_16x16-only path)**.
  `EncoderConfig::chroma_format_idc` now also accepts 3 (4:4:4); when
  paired with `profile_idc=244` (High 4:4:4 Predictive) the SPS writer
  emits the §7.3.2.1.1 chroma-extended group with `chroma_format_idc=3`
  and `separate_colour_plane_flag=0` (the decoder maps that pair to
  `ChromaArrayType=3`). Per-MB chroma planes are encoded "like luma"
  per §7.3.5.3 / §8.3.4.1: each plane has its own 16x16 DC Hadamard
  block + 16 4x4 AC blocks (§6.4.3 raster-Z), shares the luma
  Intra_16x16 prediction mode, and the `intra_chroma_pred_mode` u(v)
  field is omitted from the bitstream. New helper
  `encode_intra16x16_chroma_plane_luma_like` runs the luma transform
  pipeline on a chroma plane and writes its decoded-bit-exact recon
  back to `recon_u`/`recon_v`. Per §7.3.5.3 the per-plane chroma AC
  emit is gated by `cbp_luma == 15`, so the encoder promotes
  `cbp_luma` to 15 whenever any chroma plane has nonzero AC. Round-28
  scope:
  * IDR Intra_16x16 only (I_NxN for 4:4:4 is rejected).
  * `disable_deblocking_filter_idc=1` is forced in the slice header
    (§8.7 chroma deblock for ChromaArrayType==3 uses the LUMA filter
    ladder applied per-plane — separate plumbing exercise).
  * `separate_colour_plane_flag=0` only (separate-plane coding is
    out of scope).
  * P/B-slice paths still pin `chroma_format_idc ∈ {1}`.
  Decoder side: lifted the blanket `chroma_array_type==3` rejection in
  `reconstruct_slice_no_deblock`; new helper
  `reconstruct_chroma_intra_444` reconstructs each chroma plane via
  the §8.3.3 16x16 luma predictor + §8.5.10 Hadamard-DC + 16 AC
  blocks. New writer variant `ChromaWriteKind::Yuv444` carries the
  per-plane DC/AC arrays + their CAVLC nC contexts. New tests:
  * `sps::tests::high_444_sps_emits_chroma_extended_group_with_separate_colour_plane_flag`
  * Integration: `round28_444_encode_decode_self_roundtrip_matches_local_recon`
    (self-roundtrip + bit-exact decoder match, PSNR Y=42.25 / U=V=50.85
    on a 64x64 gradient).
  * Integration: `round28_444_ffmpeg_decode_matches_encoder_recon`
    (ffmpeg cross-decode bit-exact for all three planes,
    Y PSNR ≥ 40 dB acceptance threshold).

- **Round 27 — encoder 4:2:2 chroma support (IDR-only path)**.
  `EncoderConfig::chroma_format_idc` selects between 1 (4:2:0,
  default) and 2 (4:2:2). When set to 2, the SPS writer emits a High
  4:2:2 (`profile_idc=122`) sequence parameter set with the
  §7.3.2.1.1 chroma-extended group fields (chroma_format_idc=2,
  bit_depth_luma/chroma_minus8=0, no scaling matrix). The per-MB
  chroma path now dispatches to either:
  * 4:2:0 (`encode_chroma_residual`) — 4 4x4 sub-blocks per plane,
    2x2 Hadamard DC, `ChromaDc420` CAVLC context, 8x8 chroma tile;
    OR
  * 4:2:2 (`encode_chroma_residual_422`) — 8 4x4 sub-blocks per
    plane, 4x2 Hadamard DC (§8.5.11.2 / eq. 8-325), `ChromaDc422`
    CAVLC context, 8x16 chroma tile.
  Chroma intra prediction adds `predict_chroma_8x16` covering DC, H,
  V, Plane modes for the 4:2:2 8x16 block (§8.3.4 with `yCF=4` /
  `c=5*V` per eq. 8-147 / 8-149). The §8.7 deblock walker now uses
  `Picture::chroma_array_type` derived from the encoder config so
  chroma 4x4 edges land in the right pixel positions for both
  subsampling modes. New tests:
  * `transform::tests::chroma_dc_422_uniform_residual_round_trips_within_tolerance`
  * `transform::tests::chroma_dc_422_scan_matches_decoder_inverse`
  * `sps::tests::high_422_sps_emits_chroma_extended_group`
  * Integration: `round27_422_encode_decode_self_roundtrip_matches_local_recon`
    (self-roundtrip + bit-exact decoder match, luma PSNR ≥ 40 dB
    on a 64x64 gradient).
  * Integration: `round27_422_ffmpeg_decode_matches_encoder_recon`
    (ffmpeg cross-decode bit-exact for both planes).
  P-slice / B-slice paths still pin `chroma_format_idc=1` (4:2:0).

### Fixed

- **Encoder no longer emits `level_idc = 30` for HD/4K streams**
  (§7.4.2.1.1 / Annex A Table A-1). The pre-fix encoder hard-coded
  `level_idc = 30` (Level 3, MaxFS = 1620 mb = 720x576 SD) for
  every emitted SPS regardless of picture size, producing
  spec-non-conformant streams when encoding at 720p (3600 mb,
  needs 3.1) / 1080p (8160 mb, needs 4.0) / 4K UHD (32400 mb,
  needs 5.1) / 8K (129600 mb, needs 6.0). Strict decoders are
  entitled to reject those streams.
  * New `EncoderConfig::level_idc` field (u8). Default for new
    configs is derived from `(width, height)` via the new
    `min_level_idc_for_picture_size` helper, which walks Annex A
    Table A-1 low-to-high and picks the first level whose `MaxFS`
    covers the picture size in macroblocks. Includes Levels 1
    through 6.2 (the full 2024-08 set).
  * Hard-coded `level_idc: 30` removed from the two production
    SPS-emit sites: `Encoder::encode_idr` (CAVLC path,
    `src/encoder/mod.rs`) and `Encoder::encode_idr_cabac` (CABAC
    path, `src/encoder/cabac_path.rs`). Test fixtures using small
    synthetic dimensions (64x64) now correctly signal `level_idc = 10`.
  * 3 new unit tests
    (`encoder::level_derivation_tests::min_level_idc_picks_smallest_covering_level`,
    `encoder_config_default_level_matches_picture_size`,
    `non_aligned_dimensions_round_up_to_whole_mbs`) covering the
    full Table A-1 walk plus dimension-rounding edge cases.

- **Annex A Table A-1 — Level 1b vs Level 1.1 disambiguation**
  (§A.3.4.1). `max_dpb_mbs_for_level` now takes
  `constraint_set3_flag` and returns 396 (Level 1b) instead of 900
  (Level 1.1) when `level_idc == 11 && constraint_set3_flag == 1`.
  The shorthand `level_idc == 9` (Baseline / Constrained Baseline
  Level 1b form) also returns 396. Fixes a real over-allocation in
  the §A.3.1 / §C.4 DPB reorder-window floor: a 176x144 QCIF
  Level 1b stream (real PicSize = 99 MBs) now floors at 4 reorder
  frames, not 9, matching the spec cap. Two new regression tests
  (`max_dpb_mbs_level_1b_versus_level_1_1`,
  `level_1b_qcif_stream_sized_at_level_1b_cap_not_level_1_1`).

- **DPB output ordering when a real-world encoder under-reports
  `max_num_reorder_frames` in SPS VUI** (§E.2.1 / §A.3.1).
  `output_dpb_sizing` now floors the reorder window at the
  level-derived MaxDpbMbs/PicSize cap (§A.3.1 item h, Annex A
  Table A-1) so a stream whose actual reorder depth exceeds the
  encoder's claim is no longer bumped out of POC order. The
  textbook reproducer is solana-ad.mp4 (High@L3.1 720p, 4-deep
  B-pyramid): VUI claims `reorder=2` but the stream needs 5,
  and the §C.4 bumping process emits frames in display order
  only when the queue can hold all five. Pre-fix `oxideplay`
  saw frames arrive in something close to decode order with one
  trailing B-frame per 4 anchors; post-fix every frame on the
  3960-frame clip arrives with strictly monotonically-increasing
  pts. Two new tests (`dpb_sizing_raises_undersized_vui_to_level_cap`,
  `b_pyramid_emits_in_poc_order_at_level_31_720p`) pin the new
  behaviour.

### Performance

- decoder (round 5 — speed pass): **2.01× end-to-end on solana-ad.mp4**
  (1280×720 yuv420p High@3.1, 3960 frames, ~158s of content) —
  wall-time **89.83s → 44.76s** via `oxideplay --vo hash --ao null`,
  hash digest unchanged (`da9c18e4008cfd37`, regression-checked).
  Three independent wins, smallest-to-biggest:
  1. **`src/simd/` skeleton + `chunked` interpolate_luma /
     interpolate_chroma** matching the `oxideav-mpeg4video` pattern
     (scalar / chunked / nightly portable). The 6-tap luma FIR is
     rewritten so the H-FIR row strip is computed exactly once and
     fed to the V-FIR for the diagonal "j" position; the per-pixel
     edge-clip is hoisted out of the FIR. Bench numbers (1000 ×
     16×16 blocks): scalar 222 µs → chunked 36 µs (integer copy,
     **6.16×**); 798 µs → 109 µs (H-half-pel, **7.32×**); 805 µs →
     98 µs (V-half-pel, **8.21×**); **3645 µs → 161 µs (diagonal-j,
     22.64×)**. End-to-end contribution on solana-ad: ~4 % (~3.6 s)
     because the luma interpolator wasn't the actual hotspot at
     720p — but the kernel is now SIMD-shaped for the round-6
     widening to 1080p / 4K.
  2. **Cached debug-env-var lookups in CABAC + macroblock-layer +
     reconstruct hot paths.** Several `std::env::var(...)` calls
     (`OXIDEAV_H264_BIN_TRACE`, `OXIDEAV_H264_CABAC_DEBUG`,
     `OXIDEAV_H264_MB_TRACE`, `OXIDEAV_H264_RECON_DEBUG`,
     `OXIDEAV_H264_NO_DEBLOCK`, etc.) were resolving via a `getenv()`
     syscall on **every CABAC bin decode and every per-MB parse**.
     With ~140 M bin decisions in this 3960-frame clip that
     dominated decoder wall-time. Each var is now resolved once on
     first access and cached behind a `OnceLock<bool>` /
     `OnceLock<Option<u32>>`. End-to-end contribution: ~21 %
     (85.89 s → 68.12 s).
  3. **Eliminated per-MB clone of the CABAC neighbour grid in
     `parse_residual_cabac_only`.** The function previously cloned
     the entire `CabacNeighbourGrid` (~720 KiB on 720p) at the top
     of every macroblock parse to dodge the borrow checker between
     read-only neighbour CBF lookups and the end-of-MB writeback.
     Replaced with `nb_grid.as_deref()` for a shared re-borrow that
     NLL drops before the writeback. **Eliminates ~10 TB of
     `_platform_memmove` traffic** across the full file.
     End-to-end contribution: ~35 % (68.12 s → 44.76 s).
- decoder: deblocking-filter fast paths in `filter_vertical_edge_luma`
  / `filter_horizontal_edge_luma` / `filter_chroma_vertical_rows` /
  `filter_chroma_horizontal_cols` — when the 8-sample window across an
  edge is fully inside the picture (the common case for picture-
  internal edges), bypass the clipped `Picture::luma_at` /
  `set_luma` accessor pair and read/write the contiguous slice
  directly. Slow-path clipping retained for edges that straddle the
  picture boundary so semantics are unchanged.

### Fixed

- decoder (round 4): CABAC parse failures on real-world High-profile
  B-slice content with `transform_size_8x8_flag=1`. Two related bugs:
  (1) Table 9-24 (ctxIdx 402..=459 — Luma8x8 frame/field
  significant_coeff_flag, last_significant_coeff_flag, and
  coeff_abs_level_minus1) was missing from the CABAC context init
  pipeline, leaving every cat-5 context at the neutral
  `(m=0, n=0)` → `pStateIdx=62, valMPS=0` collapse; the arithmetic
  decoder drifted out of sync within a few hundred macroblocks. (2)
  §9.3.3.1.1.9 cat=1/2 transBlockN derivation: when the neighbour MB
  has `transform_size_8x8_flag=1` and the cbp bit covering
  `luma4x4BlkIdxN` is set, the spec assigns the neighbour's 8x8 luma
  block as transBlockN — its `coded_block_flag` is inferred to 1 from
  the CBP for ChromaArrayType < 3. Our `cabac_cbf_cond_terms` was
  short-circuiting to "transBlockN unavailable" instead. On
  `solana-ad.mp4` (1280×720 yuv420p High@3.1, 3960 frames, all B/P),
  slice-skip errors went from ~1900 to **0** end-to-end. Adds 4
  regression tests pinning Table 9-24 init values via §9.3.1.1
  eq. 9-5 hand-derivation.

### Added

- encoder: **B-slice §8.4.1.2.3 temporal direct mode (round 24)** —
  alongside the round-21/23 spatial direct path, the encoder can now
  emit B_Skip / B_Direct_16x16 / B_8x8+all-B_Direct_8x8 macroblocks
  driven by **temporal direct** MV derivation: per-8x8 (mvL0, mvL1)
  computed by POC-distance scaling of the L1 anchor's per-block
  colocated L0 motion vectors (eq. 8-191..8-202), with refIdxL0 /
  refIdxL1 collapsed to 0 for our single-ref-per-list setup
  (MapColToList0 collapses to identity since the L1 anchor's only L0
  reference is the IDR — same as the current B's L0 reference). Slice
  header now signals `direct_spatial_mv_pred_flag = 0`. New
  `EncoderConfig::direct_temporal_mv_pred` toggle (default `false` =
  spatial); new `EncodedFrameRef::pic_order_cnt` field carrying each
  reference's POC (auto-populated for `EncodedIdr` / `EncodedP` /
  `EncodedB` via the existing `From` impls). The encoder mirrors the
  decoder's §8.4.1.2.3 derivation locally (`b_temporal_direct_derive`)
  and re-uses the existing BMode chooser + `B_Direct_16x16` / `B_8x8`
  writers — only the MV/refIdx derivation differs from spatial. Five
  new integration tests (`integration_b_temporal_direct.rs`) pin the
  new behaviour: slice-header signalling check, 5-frame I-P-B-P-B
  self-roundtrip (max enc/dec diff ≤ 1 LSB on both B-frames),
  ffmpeg-interop on the same fixture (max diff ≤ 1, ≥ 38 dB PSNR_Y on
  every B), plus three boundary checks pinning the
  `derive_b_temporal_direct` helper at zero-mvCol / td-zero passthrough
  / symmetric-midpoint inputs. Round-24 caveats: still single ref per
  list (multi-ref temporal direct needs full §8.2.4 RefPicList
  construction + the MapColToList0 POC search — deferred), CAVLC only,
  no field/MBAFF, no long-term refs.
- encoder: **B_8x8 with all four `sub_mb_type = B_Direct_8x8` (round
  23)** — Table 7-14 raw mb_type 22 (`B_8x8`) + Table 7-18 raw
  sub_mb_type 0 (`B_Direct_8x8`) ×4. Zero MV / refIdx fields in the
  bitstream — the decoder re-derives all four per-8x8 (mvL0, mvL1,
  refIdxL0, refIdxL1) per §8.4.1.2.2 (spatial direct, since
  `direct_spatial_mv_pred_flag = 1` in our slice header). With
  `direct_8x8_inference_flag = 1` (hard-wired in our SPS), each 8x8
  sub-MB carries one (mvL0, mvL1) pair shared across its four 4x4
  sub-partitions. The encoder mirrors the §8.4.1.2.2 derivation locally
  (already present from round 21), now exercises the per-8x8 MV grid
  it produces by stitching four independent 8x8 luma + 4x4 chroma
  predictors into a 16x16 / 8x8 buffer and trial-coding it as a third
  Direct candidate (uniform `B_Direct_16x16` from round 21 + per-8x8
  `B_8x8`+all-Direct from round 23 + explicit/partition modes from
  round 22). Lifts the round-21 "uniform-only" gate that previously
  rejected Direct when the §8.4.1.2.2 step-7 colZeroFlag drove
  per-partition MVs to disagree. Lagrangian rate bias `(qp_y/6+1)*12`
  SAD units favours the smaller-syntax `B_Direct_16x16` over per-8x8
  Direct when the per-8x8 SAD doesn't materially beat the uniform one
  (per-8x8 syntax cost: mb_type=22 ue(9) + 4× sub_mb_type=0 ue(1) = 13
  bits vs B_Direct_16x16's 1-bit mb_type=0). New writer
  `write_b_8x8_all_direct_mb` + config `B8x8AllDirectMcbConfig`. The
  encoder's per-8x8 grid update + per-4x4 deblock-walker MV array
  honour the §8.4.1.2.2 derivation's per-8x8 MVs so the decoder's bs
  derivation sees the same MVs as the encoder. Three new integration
  fixtures (`integration_b_8x8_direct.rs`) verify bit-exact ffmpeg /
  libavcodec interop on a synthetic IPB midpoint fixture, plus two new
  unit tests for the writer (Table 7-14 / 7-18 round-trip + 14-bit
  zero-residual emit count). Round-23 caveats: spatial direct only
  (no temporal direct §8.4.1.2.3), CAVLC only, no per-sub-MB-partition
  granularity (B_8x8 paths with mixed sub_mb_type ∈ {B_Direct_8x8,
  B_L0_8x8, B_L1_8x8, B_Bi_8x8, …} are out of scope).
- encoder: **B-slice 16x8 / 8x16 partition modes (round 22)** — Table
  7-14 raw mb_types 4..=21 (`B_L0_L0_16x8` through `B_Bi_Bi_8x16`). Per-
  partition refIdx, MV, prediction mode (L0 / L1 / Bi), and §8.4.1.3
  partition-shape MVP derivation (`Partition16x8Top/Bottom`,
  `Partition8x16Left/Right`). Per-partition ME candidates pulled from the
  3-way set `{16x16-best-MV, cell-A-best-MV, cell-B-best-MV}`; mode
  decision enumerates the 9 `(mode_a, mode_b)` combos per shape and
  picks the minimum-SAD pair. Partition mode wins over 16x16 only when
  its joint SAD beats 16x16 by more than `(qp_y/6 + 1) * 8` SAD units —
  the Lagrangian rate penalty for the larger mb_type ue(v) plus the
  duplicated mvds. Bipred uses the same §8.4.2.3.1 default weighted
  average `(L0+L1+1)>>1` as round-20. The encoder's per-MB
  `MvGridSlot` now carries genuinely per-8x8 MVs (top half = #0/#1,
  bottom = #2/#3 for 16x8; left = #0/#2, right = #1/#3 for 8x16); the
  §8.4.1.3.2 C→D substitution and the per-partition `LUMA_4X4_BLK`
  Z-scan indexing of the deblock-walker's MV array are honoured so the
  decoder's bs derivation sees the same MVs as the encoder. Two new
  integration fixtures (`integration_b_partitions.rs`) verify
  bit-exact ffmpeg/libavcodec interop on a per-half-motion B-frame
  (max diff 0, 46.87 dB PSNR_Y on 16x8 split, 48.54 dB on 8x16). The
  encoder's `neighbour_mvs_16x16` now reads each neighbour's per-8x8
  cell that spatially abuts the current MB's top-left 4x4 (`#1` for
  left, `#2` for above and above-right, `#3` for above-left), matching
  the decoder's per-partition MV grid for partition-mode neighbours.
  Round-22 caveats: partition mode never overrides Direct (B_Skip
  beats partition by 0 vs ~10+ bits of mb_type / mvd cost), CAVLC only,
  single ref per list.
- encoder: **B_Skip / B_Direct_16x16 spatial-direct mode (round 21)**
  on top of round-20 explicit-inter. The encoder now mirrors the
  §8.4.1.2.2 derivation locally using its own L0 / L1 MV grids plus
  the L1 anchor's per-block colocated MVs (new
  `EncodedFrameRef::partition_mvs`, populated by `encode_p`). When the
  derived predictor's SAD is competitive with the explicit-inter
  candidates (under a Lagrangian rate bias of `(qp_y/6 + 1) * 16` SAD
  units), the encoder emits **B_Direct_16x16** (raw mb_type 0, no mvds
  / ref_idx in the bitstream) — or **B_Skip** if the residual quantises
  to zero (folded into a `mb_skip_run` ue(v)). On a 16-MB static-content
  B-frame (IDR + P + B all from the same source), the new path
  collapses the B-slice from 75 → 11 bytes (~85% reduction) with
  identical PSNR (52.36 dB Y, max enc/dec diff 0, bit-equivalent
  against ffmpeg/libavcodec). Implements §8.4.1.2.1 colocated-block
  selection, §8.4.1.2.2 step 4 (MinPositive on refIdxLX), step 5
  (directZeroPredictionFlag), step 7 (colZeroFlag short-circuit), and
  §8.4.1.3 median MV prediction. Round-21 caveats: spatial direct only
  (no temporal direct), 16x16 partitions only (no B_Direct_8x8 / B_8x8),
  per-8x8 uniformity gate skips Direct when the derivation's per-
  partition MVs disagree.
- encoder: B-slice support (round 20). Explicit B_L0_16x16 / B_L1_16x16
  / B_Bi_16x16 macroblock types via the new `Encoder::encode_b` entry
  point. SPS bumps to Main profile (profile_idc=77) since §A.2.2
  forbids B-slices in Baseline; `EncoderConfig::profile_idc` and
  `max_num_ref_frames` are now part of the public configuration.
  Per-MB SAD-driven L0/L1/Bi mode decision; bipred uses §8.4.2.3.1
  default weighted average `(L0+L1+1)>>1`. Two-list MV-pred grids
  (independent §8.4.1.3 mvpLX derivation per list). `MbDeblockInfo`
  extended with `mv_l1` / `ref_idx_l1` / `ref_poc_l1` so the §8.7.2.1
  bipred edge-strength derivation sees the right per-list identity.
  ffmpeg/libavcodec decodes the B-slice **bit-equivalently** (max diff
  0) at 54.19 dB PSNR_Y on a synthetic IPB fixture; our own decoder
  agrees bit-for-bit. Round-20 caveats: no B_Skip, no B_Direct, no
  intra fallback in B, single ref per list, no sub-MB partitions.
- encoder: 4MV / P_8x8 with all sub_mb_type = PL08x8 (round 19).
  Per-8x8 quarter-pel ME, content-driven SAD heuristic gate (≥30%
  SAD reduction over 1MV), §8.4.1.3 within-MB-aware mvp derivation.
  ffmpeg interop bit-equivalent on a per-sub-block-shifted fixture;
  40.95 dB PSNR_Y.
- encoder: P-slice support (round 16). Single L0 reference, integer-pel
  motion estimation, P_Skip + P_L0_16x16 macroblock types. Self-roundtrip
  + ffmpeg interop bit-exact on a 2-frame I+P fixture; PSNR vs source
  ~50 dB on integer-shift content.

### Removed

- **Entire previous implementation.** The pre-rewrite codebase decodes
  many H.264 streams but accumulates spec-deviations on real-world
  content that bug-by-bug fixing stopped paying off; archived to the
  [`old`](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav-h264/tree/old) branch
  for reference.

### Added

- Empty crate skeleton with the standard CI / release-plz / LICENSE
  layout. `register()` is a no-op so the workspace aggregator keeps
  building.
- `README.md` is now a spec coverage matrix that grows with the
  rewrite.

### Notes

The rewrite is driven by ITU-T Rec. H.264 | ISO/IEC 14496-10 (2024-08
edition) as the single authoritative source. No external decoder code
is consulted while writing the implementation; conformance is verified
by behavioural diff against an external reference decoder run
separately.
